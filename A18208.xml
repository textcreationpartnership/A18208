            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>It is now long ſince that my hart hath had, not only a verie inward compaſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your miſeries, but alſo a vearie earneſt deſire to preſent vnto you ſome godlie Treatiſe, which might both be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatorie vnto you amidſt your diſcomforts, and a patterne for your conformitie vnto the life of Chriſt. Knowe you therfore, that amongſt all the vertues which can ſhine in a
<pb facs="tcp:8350:3"/> perfect and conſtant Chriſtian, the forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of worldly riches, and the patient ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting of tribulations, are two moſt noble and incomparable vertues; Which doctrin was ſet foorth by our Sauiour him ſelfe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he willed the young man in the goſpell; firſt, to forſake all that he had; and next, to take vp his croſſe and to followe him.</p>
            <p>Vnto this contempt of worldly riches (eſpecially when there is queſtion of the honor of God, or zeale of vertu) many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, not only ſacred but prophane, doe plentifully exhort vs. Bias one of the ſeauen Sages of Greece, ſeeing his cuntrie all in fire and flames, and euery man gathering of moueables and riches to carrie with him, beeing admoniſhed by one to doe the like, ſaid. Truly ſo I doe, for all myne I carrie with me (meaning his vertues). Crates the Philoſopher, hauing caſt all his monie into the bottom of the ſea, ſaid. <hi>Malo te perdere, quam vt tu me perdas.</hi> I had rather caſt away thee, then that thou ſhould caſt away me. Ariſtippus coming to Diogenes, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him waſhing his rootes, ſaid vnto him; Thou bening a wiſe man, and a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
<pb facs="tcp:8350:3"/> if thou vvouldeſt credit me, thou ſhouldſt not neede to vvaſh rootes, but ſhouldſt remaine in the court of a noble Prince with me. To whom Diogenes anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered; and if thou, quoth he, wilt credit me, and vſe meane pouertie, thou oughteſt not with flatterie to lie to Princes.</p>
            <p>To applie theſe examples vnto our ſelues; That of Bias doth teache, that vertu is the only iewel which a wiſe man ſhould ſeeke to preſerue before al worldly riches. That of Crates: that riches are to be caſt from vs, &amp; to be renounced, when they can not be kept without the hinderance of vertu, or offence of God. That of Diogenes: that the vertu of pouertie with peace of conſcience, is far to be perferred before a princes fauour, when for the ſame we muſt flatter or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble againſt our conſcience. And thus you ſee in theſe heathen Philoſophers which knewe no God, what riches they contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: what treaſures they deſpiſed: what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors they refuſed: &amp; what pouerty they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, only for the zeale of morall vertu.</p>
            <p>But alas ſo paſſing greate is the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and abuſed iudgment of many in
<pb facs="tcp:8350:4"/> theſe our dayes, that no man is deemed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie, but he that is in honor: no man wiſe, but he that is wealthie: no man wretched but he that is in wantes: nor no kinde of puniſhement like to worldly pouertie. How many are there who expoſe their ſoules to euerlaſting perill, thorough the inordinate loue of their worldly riches? And how few are there, who like vnto the mariners, when they ſee any ſtormes or tempeſtes ariſe at ſea, doe caſt out of their ſhip their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and marchandiſe to ſaue their liues? This cauſed holie S. Bernard to crye out and ſay. <hi>O Vtinam congregata perirent, &amp; non congregator eorum.</hi> O would to God the thinges gathered might only periſh, and not their gatherer. This cauſed holie Dauid to crie out and ſay. <hi>Cadent à latere tuo mille, &amp; decem millia à dextris tuis.</hi> There ſhall fall a thouſand on thy left ſide, &amp; ten thouſand on thy right ſide. By the right hand ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, is ſignified riches and proſperitie, and by the left pouertie and aduerſitie. In both theſe men are mightilie aſſaulted: many fall, and many are quite ouercome: but without compariſon far greater ſlaughter
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:8350:4"/> is made in the time of proſperitie, wealth, and pleaſure, then in the time of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie pouertie and miſerie. And this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed S. Gregorie to ſay, that the ſeruantes of God in his world, are more a fraid of proſperitie, then they are of aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
            <p>For this reſpect our mercifull Lord, out of his tender loue to his elect, and fore-knowing to what hurt and danger their riches may turne them, if they ſhould beare an inordinate loue vnto them, by ſundrie meanes, doth take them from them. Imitatinge herein the cunning hunter; who hauing eſpied out the tree againſt the which the Elephant vſeth to leane when he would ſleepe, doth ſaw aſunder the tree: wherunto he thinking to repoſe, falleth downe, and ſo is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Euen ſo doth God; from ſome, by cutting a ſunder the liues of their frendes: from others, by taking from them their temporall goods, vnto which they leaned more then to him: and vnto others, by touching them with ſundrie kindes of tribulations. Which yet he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8350:5"/> doth, not of any hate, but of a ſpeciall loue which he beareth vnto them. In fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure whereof, Iſaac ſaid vnto Eſau, <hi>gen.</hi> 27. <hi>Come neere me that I may touch thee, and that I may proue if thou be my ſonne.</hi> And S. Gregorie, askinge the queſtion, what was wanting to Iob that he ſhould be afflicted, ſeeing he was adorned with all vertu; This, ſaith he, that he might knowe to giue thankes in aduerſitie. For as the Apoſtle S. Paul ſaith; <hi>Vertu is perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in infirmitie.</hi> To vvhich purpoſe, vvhen a certaine perſon beſought a holie man, that by his praiers he vvould deliuer him of his ſicknes; the holie man hauing heard that he vvas better and deuouter in his ſicknes then in his health, anſvvered; I beſeeche our Lord to keepe thee in that ſtate, in vvhich thou art beſt. For vvell he knevve that our Lorde hath a vvonderfull care ouer ſuch as he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to be afflicted. Vnto vvhom he is, as the phiſitien is to the patient, vvho fighteth not againſt the man, but againſt his diſeaſe. Vnto vvhom he ſpeedely run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth as to a hurt member of his bodie,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8350:5"/> and vvith a moſt ſpeciall care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence doth looke vnto him, and povvre into his ſoule moſt plentifull ſtore of heauenly grace and diuine conſolation.</p>
            <p>Novv Madam, for as much as you haue voluntarily depriued your ſelfe of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and pleaſures of this vvorld, for the honor of God, hovv may you not ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reioyce vvith our Sauiour Chriſt and ſay. <hi>Nunc venit princeps mundi huius &amp; in me non habet quicquam.</hi> Novv the prince of this vvorld cometh, and in me he hath nothing. And hauing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviſe ſo paciently ſupported ſo great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, hovv may vve not al vvith vvon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſay. <hi>Venite &amp; videte opera Domini, quae po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit prodigia ſuper terram.</hi> Come and ſee the vvorkes of our Lorde, vvhat vvonders he hath put vpon the earth. For as Sampſon being demanded vvherein his great force and ſtrenght conſiſted, confeſſed it to lye hid in moſt vveake haires: ſo truly vve may rightly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe &amp; ſay the like, that God hath hidden in a moſt vveake ſex, moſt vvorthie valor, victorie and inuincible courage. You may vvell be confident in the goodnes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8350:6"/> of him, who neuer permiteth any to be tempted aboue their abilitie. For our Lord dealeth with the iuſt, as he which caſteth, a pretious glaſſe vp on highe, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it to fall vntill it come neere the ground, and then catcheth it and ſaueth it that it be not broken: meaning the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby not to breake the glaſſe, but to ſhew his art, that he knoweth how to ſaue it, euen when to others it ſeemeth to be vtterly loſt.</p>
            <p>Wherfore, good Madam, nether let your longe afflictions ſeeme tedious vnto you, nor account that loſt which you haue left for Chriſt. If we caſt water about the roote of a fruitfull tree, we doe not thinke that water loſt, becauſe we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect great aboundance of fruite: euen ſo, that which we forgoe for the loue of Chriſt, is not loſt, for we ſhall gather of that tree, the fruite of eternall life. Rather reioyce herein, that by this your patience and ſufferance you preſerue your ſoule in the grace and fauour of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God; Which ſuch as this world would be if the ſunne were taken from
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8350:6"/> it, ſuch is a ſoule when it is depriued of the light of grace. Againe reioyce for that you are made herein a true imitator and follower of Chriſt: who as S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine ſaith, did him ſelfe contemne all earthly goods, to ſhew that they ought to be contemned; and likevviſe ſuffered in him ſelfe all earthly euills, vvhich he commandeth vs to ſuffer; that nether in the one ſhould be thought felicitie, nether in the other ſhould be feared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicitie. Againe reioyce for that there is laid vp for you a copious revvard in the kingdome of heauen. For if to him that had employed his fiue talents and made them ten, ſo great a recompence vvas aſſured, vvhat a vvonderfull recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence ſhall you receiue for more then ten hundred poundes a yeare vvhich you haue forſaken for the loue of Chriſt? Hovv ſhall not our Sauiour ſay vnto you. <hi>Well done good and faithfull ſeruant, becauſe thou hast bene faithfull in litle I will ſet thee ouer much, enter into thy Masters ioy.</hi> Againe reioyce for that you haue ſo vviſely defeated the diuell, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:8350:7"/> and eſcaped and auoided his craftie ſnares, whoſe ſutteltie and meaning was, by diſpoſeſſing you of yours, to haue poſeſſed him ſelfe of you. For the Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell when he depriueth vs of our worldly ſubſtance, doth it not for the loue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for that ſuch thinges, are not ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to him; it is our ſoule that he would gayne, all the reſt he nothing regardeth. For ſo he tooke from Iob, his ſubſtance, his children, and the health of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, but chiefly intended to deſtroy his ſoule.</p>
            <p>Now therfore, for as much as it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerance which bringeth euery vertu to his perfection, you muſt euer be furniſhed with perfect Fortitude, the only vertu of all others inſuperable; for all the world can not ouercome one man in whom is true Fortitude. And as Seneca ſaith. It is more eaſie to ouercome one whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then one ſuch man. For what can all the enimies and perſecutors in the world doe, when they haue done the vtmoſt of their malice, but that which euery litle ague, or any other litle diſeaſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8350:7"/> can doe vnto you as well as they?

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here was in Siena, which is an ancient citie of Tuſcan in Italie, a certaine man called <hi>Iames benin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſa,</hi> a dyer by occupation, no ritch man of ſubſtance, but hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently well to liue. He liued, as he was brought vp, in the feare of God: and towardes the worlde he was a plaine and vpright dealing man, welbeloued of all, that had anie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation with him, by reaſon of his ſweet and gentle demeanour: which vertue emong manie other, was noted in him to be ſingular. This <hi>Iames</hi> tooke to, wife a woman called <hi>Lapa,</hi> who was likewiſe a vertuous woman, verie careful and diligent about her familie, and withal of verie modeſt, chaſt, and womanlie behauiour. And
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8350:10"/> therfore almightie God bleſſed her with manie children, of the which ſhe bare for the moſt part euerie yeare one, and ſome yeares two. Laſt of all it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe, that ſhe brought foorth two daughters at one byrth. The one was called <hi>Ione,</hi> which, after ſhe was baptiſed, liued not many daies. The other was this <hi>Catharine,</hi> of whom we mynd here to ſpeake: whom the mother brought vp with great diligence, and loued more tenderly then ſhe did the reſt of her children, bicauſe the reſt coming on ſo faſt one vpon an other, that ſhe might not endure to nourſe them her ſelfe, but put them out to others, this only ſhe nourſed at home with the mylke of her owne breſtes: which was one great cauſe of ſpecial loue. But the thing, that did moſt principally moue the mother to caſt a ſingular affection towardes this daughter, was a certaine vnwonted and meruelous grace, which ſhewed in the deliteful preſence, deedes, geſtures, and wordes of this child, euen in the tyme of her tender in fancie. For when ſhe was but only wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the mothers mylke, and could a litle goe about the howſe, the parentes and neighbours thought they could neuer haue their fill of ſeeyng and hearing her: her countenance was ſo ſweet and amiable, her talke ſo wittie and to ſo good purpoſe. And as ſhe grewe in yeares, ſo did ſhe alſo increaſe in grace and wiſedome: in ſo much, that when ſhe was fiue yeares old, hauing then learned the <hi>Aue Marie,</hi> ſhe vſed continually to ſaie the ſame with ripe iudgement and feruent deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8350:10"/> And going vp and downe a paire of ſtayers that were in the howſe, her maner was to ſay one <hi>Aue Marie</hi> vpon euerie ſteppe, kneeling vpon her knees with great reuerence. The which ſingular deuotion towardes our bleſſed Ladie, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table it was to almightie God, it may right well appeere by the moſt excellent graces and priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that enſued therupon euen in her tender age: which were vndoubtedly moſt certaine tokens of a verie noble &amp; high calling, of God: as hereafter ſhalbe declared more at large.</p>

                  <p>When ſhe was ſixe yeares olde, her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeing her to be of a verie tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly wit, ſent her on a daie with her brother <hi>Steuen,</hi> who was ſomewhat elder then ſhe, to a ſiſters howſe of theirs called <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tura</hi> a maried woman, either to ſee how ſhe did (as the maner of kinsfolkes is) or els in ſome other arrand. When ſhe had done, what ſhe was willed by her mother to doe, ſhe returned homewardes againe: and paſſing by a ſtreet, which is called in their tongue <hi>Valle piatta,</hi> ſhe caſt vp her head a litle, and looked towardes the Church of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> which ſtood there right ouer againſt her, and behould, ſhe ſawe in the aier a goodlie chamber
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8350:11"/> royally decked, and in it our Lord and ſauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſitting in a ſeat imperial, clad with a ſolemne pontifical robe, wearing on his head a mitre, ſuch as the biſshops of Rome are wont to weare: and with him ſhe ſawe the Apoſtles <hi>S. Peter,</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and <hi>S Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt. When this bleſſed infant beheld all this, at the firſt ſhe was aſtoniſhed. But afterward being come to her ſelfe, and well aduiſed, ſhe caſt vp her eyes, both of body and ſowle, to her Sauiour: who likewiſe caſt the eyes of his diuine maieſtie vpon her, with a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelie and ſmyling cheere. And ſtretching out his right hand towardes her and ouer her, made the ſigne of the Croſſe (as the maner of biſshops and prelats is to doe) and gaue her his bleſſing. The which foorthwith wrought ſo effectually and mightily in her, that ſhe was rauiſhed and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed ſpiritually into that moſt glorious and beawtiful Lord; whom ſhe beheld with ſuch an inward and ſpiritual liking, that ſhe forgat, not only her going and waie, but alſo her own ſelfe. In ſo much that ſhe ſtoode ſtill there, without mouing any part of her bodie: &amp; ſo would ſhe haue ſtood, not only then, but manie other tymes alſo, without regard or feare of either men or beaſtes, (which are wont to be dreadful to litle childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) if ſhe had not ben towched, or taken awaie by ſome other. But at the lenght her brother <hi>Steuen,</hi> who was gone on his waie, imaginyng that ſhe had folowed, turnyng backe and ſeeing her a great waie behind, ſtanding ſtill in the waie, &amp; looking
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:8350:11"/> vp into the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, cried vnto her alowd &amp; called her by her nam; But ſhe gaue him no word to anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were: for ſhe was in deed ſo wholly occupied in al her ſenſes both in wardly &amp; outwardly, that ſhe gaue no heed to his crying: whereupon he went neerer and neerer, and euermore as he went, he cried vnto her. But all was to no purpoſe, vntill he came at length to the verie place, where ſhe ſtood, &amp; tooke her by the hand, ſaying. What doeſt thou here: whie comeſt thou not awaie? At the which wordes and pulling of her hand, ſhe caſt downe her eyes a litle, like one that had ben awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of a dead ſleepe, and ſaid. Oh, ſaid ſhe, if thou haddeſt ſeene that goodlie ſight, that I ſawe, thou wouldeſt neuer haue done ſo to me. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had ſaid thoſe wordes, ſhe caſt vp her eyes againe, thinking to haue ſeene it, as ſhe did before. But when ſhe ſawe that it was vaniſhed awaie, ſhe reuenged the iniurie done vnto her by her brother, as childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are wont to doe, with weping. And it grieued her ſo much the more, bicauſe ſhe perſwaded her ſelfe, that by the caſting downe of her eyes, ſhe had deſerued to leeſe the blisful fruition of that glorious ſight. Thus ended this wonderful viſion, leauing her with ſuch a thirſt and languiſhing loue after that heauenlie beawtie, which ſhe had ſeene, that from this tyme forward her whole care and ſtudie was, how to recouer the ſame againe. Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord had after this maner watered the roote of his litle pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8350:12"/> with the dewe of his ſweet bleſſing, ſhe began foorthwith to yeald, not only buddes &amp; bloſſomes of great matters in expectation, but alſo ripe frutes of diuerſe and ſundrie excellent and perfecte ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: in ſo much that in all her behauiour ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to all thoſe, that God vowchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to conuerſe with her, not like an infant, as her yeares required; nor yet like a young woman, (which not withſtanding in that age had ben a verie ſtrange matter) but like a graue and ſad matrone. This heauenlie fyer of Gods holie loue had wrought ſuch an alteration in her hart, ſuch a light in her vnderſtanding, ſuch a feruour in her will, ſuch a plyantnes in all her powers, both of bodie and ſowle, to folowe the inſtincte of his holie Spirite, that to them, that ſawe her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, and tooke good heed to her wordes and deedes, it ſeemed that ſhe was wholly transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into IESVS-CHRIST her ſweet ſpowſe and Sauiour. In ſo much that on a daie going to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion (as her maner was) ſhe declared of her ſelfe to her goſtlie father, that ſhe had learned the liues and auſteritie of diuerſe auncient fathers in Egipt, &amp; other Sainctes, and ſpecially of the holy patriarke <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> not by the teaching of men, nor by reading in bookes, but by reuelation from God: and that ſhe had ſuch a deſire to frame her life after the examples and rules of thoſe holy men, that ſhe could think vpon none other thing, but only how to bring the ſame to paſſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon ſhe entred into a newe courſe of life, which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8350:12"/> was ſo ſtrange &amp; vnwonted (eſpecially in that tender age) that all men had great wonder of it. Firſt of all ſhe gaue ouer all maner of plaie and ſport, wherein yong children are wont to take delite. Then ſhe withdrewe her ſelfe from all companie, that ſhe might haue the freer and more familiar acceſſe to God, in holie meditations and praiers. She bound her ſelfe to a wonderfull kinde of ſilence, ſhe puniſhed her bodie with much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, and other hard diſcipline. The which that ſhe might doe with the more commoditie &amp; ſecrecy, ſhe ſought out a priuie place in the howſe, where ſhe might ſcourge her ſelfe with a cord, which ſhe had prouided for that purpoſe. And as ſhe was a towardlie ſcholer in the ſchoole of Chriſt, yealding her ſelfe verie ployantly to be lead from vertue to vertue, whether ſoeuer it pleaſed the ſpirite of God to lead her: ſo was ſhe alſo a diligent and diſcrete ſchole-miſtres, and vſed meanes to allure and trayne other litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo of her age, in the ſame patthes of vertue and auſtere life. In ſo much, that when the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours children reſorted vnto her (as they did oftentymes) being ſterred to grace by the ſweet wordes, and holie example of this gratious infant, they would gather them ſelues together in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſecret place of the howſe, which ſhe had choſen out for the nonce, and there would they ſcourge them ſelues, as they ſawe her to doe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meane tyme ech of them, a certaine nomber of <hi>Pater noſters</hi> and <hi>Aue Maries,</hi> according
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8350:13"/> as ſhe preſcribed them to ſaie. By theſe &amp; other the like exerciſes of piety and deuotion, ſhe fownd ſuch fauour in the ſight of her heauenlie ſpowſe, that verie manie tyme, when ſhe ſet hir ſelf to goe vp and downe thoſe ſtaiers in her fathers howſe, ſaying her <hi>Aue Maries</hi> after ſuch ſort as we decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before, it was ſeene by diuerſe and ſundrie perſones, that ſhe was caried ſenſibly in the ayer by the almightie power of God and miniſterie of Angels; without towching anie ſteppe of the ſame with her feete. And this happened vnto her, namely at thoſe tymes, when ſhe retired her ſelfe from all companie, and ſpecially of men. And there is no doubt, but that it happened in that place, to geue her and others to vnderſtand, how acceptable that deuotion towardes the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mother of God, which ſhe exerciſed in that place, was to almightie God.</p>

But ſhe could not deuiſe, how to bring her deſired purpoſe to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8350:13"/> paſſe. And bicauſe it was not the will of God, that ſhe ſhould take that trade of life in ſuch maner as ſhe deſired, he left her in this point to her owne natural wit, and would geue her none other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but only what her owne childiſh wit could deuiſe. Wherupon to accompliſh the great deſire that ſhe had to ſerue God in the wildernes, on a daie tymely in the mornyng, ſhe made her prouiſion (like a child) of one loafe of bread, and with the ſame tooke her waie towardes her ſiſters howſe, which was maried, &amp; dwelt neere vnto the gate of <hi>S. Anſanus.</hi> Howbeit ſhe entred not into the howſe, as ſhe was wont to doe, but paſſed by, and went out at the gate: (and ſo did ſhe neuer before that tyme.) And ſo paſſing foorth, vntill ſhe came at the lenght, where ſhe ſawe the howſes ſtanding one here and an other there, and not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as ſhe was wont to ſee them in the citie, ſhe bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be glad &amp; hoped wel, that ſhe was neere to the wildernes.

And foorth with ſhe entred into the ſame with paſſing great ioye &amp; gladnes; for ſhe perſuaded her ſelfe verily, that ſhe had now fownd out that wildernes, that ſhe ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And when ſhe was entred, ſhe ſtood not long to conſider of the opportunitie of the place, or how ſhe might acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate her ſelfe in that newe oratorie, but by and by without anie further aduiſement or conſideration, ſhe fell downe

As ſhe was praying with a verie vehement bent of mynd, ſhe was taken vp by litle and litle from the earth, where ſhe kneeled: and her bodie was lifted vp as high as the height of the caue would ſuffer her to riſe. And ſo ſhe continued from mornyng till noone. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe perceiued, that ſhe was thus lifted vp from the earth, ſhe began to feare and to ſuſpecte, that it might be ſome deceite of the ghoſtlie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whoſe drifte might be, by this meane to put her in feare, and ſo to hinder her deſignement of going into the wildernes. And therfore ſhe ſet her ſelfe to praie more feruently, and to abaſe her ſelf more and more before God. Wherevpon about that verie hower, that our Sauiour after his paſſion was taken downe from the Croſſe, it pleaſed his diuine maieſty, that ſhe likewiſe ſhould deſcend by litle, and litle in like maner as ſhe had aſcended. And he made her to vnderſtand by his ſecret inſpiration, that the tyme was not yet come, in the which ſhe ſhould forſake her fathers howſe, and put her bodie to ſuch penance and affliction.

                  <p>SVch was the vertue and operation of this afore mentioned reuelation, that it drewe al wordlie loue and affection out of the hart of this yong maid, and wrought in the ſame a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine holie loue to the Sonne of God only, and to his moſt glorious mother the virgin Marie. And this loue was ſo great, that ſhe accounted all the delites and pleaſures of this wordle as verie durt and dong, in compariſon of her ſweet ſpowſe Ieſus Chriſt. Moreouer, being now ſeuen yeares old, ſhe had learned only by the inward inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:8350:15"/> of the holie Ghoſt in her hart, that is was a goodly ſtate of life, &amp; withal verie acceptable vnto God, to liue in all puritie &amp; cleannes both of bodie and ſowle. She had learned alſo, that our bleſſed Ladie the moſt pure &amp; vnſpotted mother of God, was the firſt that dedicated her ſelfe by vowe to ſerue God in that moſt cleane and perfecte ſtate of virginitie. And therfore ſhe thought it moſt expedient, for the obteinyng of that grace, to make her humble ſuite to her, who had before al others obteined the ſame at Gods hand for her ſelfe, and vndoubtedly for all thoſe, that ſhould afterwardes require it at her hand, with the like humilitie and earneſt deſire. Being therfore of the age of ſeuen yeares, ſhe ſet her ſelfe verie grauely &amp; ſadly to take aduiſement, what order of life was beſt for her to take: and for the better reſolution in that point, ſhe praied to our bleſſed Ladie, queene of Angels and virgins, that it would pleaſe her to make interceſſion to her deere Sonne, that he would vowchſafe to teach her by the inſtincte of his ſpirite, what waie ſhe might beſt take, that were moſt to his glorie and to her ſowles health. Our bleſſed Ladie, mother of pitie and comfort by whoſe gracious mocion this holie deſire was firſt planted in her hart, heard the diſcrete dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und of this wiſe yong virgin, and anſwered her iuſt requeſt, Firſt with a dailie increaſe of greater deſire &amp; longing after the thing requeſted, which was to knowe, how ſhe might order her life, to be moſt acceptable vnto God, &amp; then alſo with a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8350:15"/> reſolution from God, certifying, her by ſecret inſpiration in her hart, that his will and pleaſure was, that ſhe ſhould ſerue him with all purity both of bodie and ſowle, in the ſtate of virginitie. The, which when ſhe vnderſtood, ſhe ſuffred not that heauenlie fyer enkendled in her hart, to be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nor to ſlake, but being wholly inflamed with the loue of that moſt excellent and goodlie maner of life, ſhe choſe out a ſecret place in the howſe, farre from the conuerſation of all perſones, where ſhe might with the more freedome of ſpirite, offer vp her praiers and vowes to almightie God: and there compoſing her ſelfe, both in bodie and mynd with all humilitie, ſhe made her praier after this maner. O moſt bleſſed Ladie, O moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſacred virgin, mother of God, which before all other women diddeſt by vowe, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate thy virginitie vnto God, &amp; becameſt therby ſo gratious in his ſight, that he would haue his only Sonne to be borne of thee: I moſt humbly beſeech thee, truſting not in anie merites of myne owne, but only in thyne vnſpeakable pitie, that thou wilt vowchſafe to obteine me ſuch grace and fauour with thy only begote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this day fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I may take him for the lawful &amp; deerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſpowſe of my ſowle. And I here geue my faith and promiſe both to him, and to thee, that I ſhall neuer take other ſpowſe, but ſhall by the aſſiſtance of his holie grace, doe what in me lieth, to keepe my ſelfe a true, and vndefiled virgin to him alone. Thus praied this yong
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8350:16"/> handmaid of Chriſt with great lowlines and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of of ſpirite; And her praier was heard, her vowe accepted, and ſhe receiued to be the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled ſpowſe of the vnſpotted lambe of God Ieſus Chriſt. The which thing when ſhe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (as ſhe did by and by, by the inward inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holie Ghoſt) being repleniſhed with a certaine holie feare, ſhe emploied her whole care and ſtudie, how ſhe might beſt keepe her ſelfe chaſt, &amp; true to her deere ſpowſe. And though as yet ſhe felt no motion to vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in her fleſh, yet to prouide like a wiſe woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for the tyme to come, ſhe began euen in thoſe tender yeares, to tame her bodie with faſting, watching, &amp; abſtinence from all deliteful thinges, and namely from eating of fleſh. In ſo much, that when anie fleſh was laid vnto her at the table, either ſhe gaue it to her brother <hi>Steuen</hi> that ſate by her, or els ſhe conueied it priuily awaie, that no man might ſee it. She praied verie often and much, &amp; ſubdued her bodie with much hard and ſharpe diſcipline, ſometymes by her ſelfe alone, &amp; ſometymes with other yong children, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted vnto her at tymes, and were as it were trayned vnder her in ſpiritual exerciſes. And ſo with theſe and other the like workes, ſhe preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; increaſed the graces of God, that were pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>AFter that this yong virgin had thus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powſed her ſelf to the Sonne of God, ſhe was wholly enflamed with the holie fire of his heauenlie loue in ſuch ſort, that ſhe had a paſſing great deſire and zeale not only to be vnited her ſelfe to him with a pure and ſyncere loue, but alſo to wynne other ſowles alſo. By reaſon of the which zeale ſhe caſt a ſpeciall affection to thoſe Sainctes, that ſhe vnderſtood had taken paines ſpecially about the bringyng of ſowles vnder the ſweet yoke and obedience of Chriſt. And vnderſtanding by reuelation from God, that <hi>S. Dominicke</hi> had inſtitued the order of the friars Preachers to that end, ſhe had the brethren of that order in ſuch reuerence, that when ſhe ſawe anie of them paſſing by her fathers howſe, ſhe would goe after them with great humilitie and deuotion, and kiſſe the verie ſteppes, where they had ſet their feet. She had alſo a meruelous great deſire to be profeſſed her ſelfe in that rule, that ſhe with the reſt of the brethren might doe, what in her laie, to wynne ſome ſowles vnto God. But when ſhe ſawe, that ſhe might not doe ſo, bicauſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8350:17"/> ſhe was a woman, ſhe thought to take an other waie, which was, to goe into ſome farre countreys and there to change her apparel, and ſo to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into ſome cloiſter for a man. Thus ſhe thought of her ſelfe, but yet not altogether wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout ſome preſident. For ſhe had vnderſtood befor of <hi>S. Euphroſina</hi> (by whoſe name ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, while ſhe was a litle one, peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by Gods prouidence to for-ſignifie this holie deſigneme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) that ſhe had after ſuch a maner cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged her attire, and liued a verie religious and ſtreight kind of life in a monaſterie among men. But though this deſire and purpoſe continued long in her mynd, yet at the lenght by her humble and continual praier, ſhe obteined at Gods hand to vnderſtand, that he would not haue her to take that waie: wherupon ſhe gaue it ouer. Now this yong virgin waxed faſt in the growth and ſtature of her bodie, but much faſter in the encreaſe of vertue, in meekenes, in deuotion, in graue and womanlie behauiour, demeanyng her ſelfe in all her wordes and deedes ſo diſcretly, and with ſuch an vnwonted grauitie in that age, that her paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, acquaintance, &amp; neighbours had her in great admiration. Emongeſt a nomber of thinges, that paſſed verie notably of that ſort, this one acte (me thinketh) is not to be paſſed ouer with ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. It befell on a daie, that her mother, hauing a ſpecial deuotion to <hi>S. Anthonie,</hi> would haue a Maſſe to be ſaid in the honour of the ſaid Saincte. Wherupon ſhe called her daughter vnto her, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:8350:17"/> taking her certaine candels and money in her hand, ſaid theſe wordes vnto her. Goe daughter (ſaid ſhe) to the church, &amp; praie our pariſh Prieſt, that he will ſing or cauſe to be ſong, a Maſſe in the honour of <hi>S. Antonie;</hi> And offer vp this money and candels vpon the aulter. She tooke the money and candels of her mother willingly (as ſhe was euermore verie glad and readie, to doe whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe was commanded by her parentes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it tended to the honour of God) and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t without anie tariance to the church, and did as ſhe was willed to doe. And furthermore for her owne priuate deuotion, ſhe continued out the whole Maſſe, and all the reſt of the diuine ſeruice. Now her mother thought ſhe would haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned home againe, ſo ſoone as ſhe had made her oblation vnto the Prieſt. And therfore when ſhe was come home, to make her aſhamed of her long tarying, ſhe ſpake vnto her, as the maner of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is to ſpeake vnto litle children. Curſed be thoſe wicked tongues (ſaid ſhe) that ſaid, my daughter ſhould come no more. She is come at the lenght, though it be long firſt. The child hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe wordes, held her ſelfe ſtill for a while, and gaue no word againe. But after a good ſpace, when ſhe had, as it were, well aduiſed her ſelfe, ſhe tooke her mother aſide, and with great ſadnes of countenance ſaid meekely vnto her. Good mother, when yee ſee, that I do tranſgreſſe anie commandement of yours,

But one thing I praie you: for my faultes curſe no man or woman in the wordle, good or bad, for it is vnſeemelie for you to doe it, and to me, it is a great griefe of mynd to heare it. The mother was ſo aſtoined at the diſcrete anſwere and graue counſel of her yong daughter, that for a good tyme ſhe could not deuiſe how to ſay anie more vnto her. How beit bicauſe ſhe would not haue her to vnderſtand ſo much, ſhe turned to her againe and ſaid. Whie, werte thou then ſo long awaie? Deere mother (ſaid ſhe) I taried to heare that Maſſe, and the reſt of the diuine ſeruice: and that done, I came ſtreight home, without tarying in anie place.

                  <p>WHen this maid was now come to the age of twelue yeares &amp; vpward, her father and mother tooke great care, how they might beſtowe her honeſtly in mariage; for the better perfourmance wherof, that there might not lacke anie grace or comelines to ſet her foorth withal, that either was in her by nature, or might be had by diligence: her mother, after the maner of women in that countrey (in deed rather much vſed, then greatly commended) was earneſt with her, that ſhe ſhould beſtowe more tyme and diligence, in waſhing and ſcowring her ſkynne, in kembing and coulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her haire, in plucking vp ſuch haires as grewe in her face or necke diſorderedly, and in other the like vaine and ſuperfluous attendances, about the trymming and decking of her bodie, to pleaſe the eyes of men. But the yong ſpowſe of Chriſt, whoſe hart was wholly preuented with the loue of the faireſt &amp; beawtifulleſt emong the ſonnes of men, who had alſo both the louelines of her ſpowſe, and her owne faith and truth, ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8350:19"/> lately plight to him, euermore preſent before her eyes, could in no wiſe be induced, to withdrawe anie tyme from the inward decking of her ſoule, to make it appeere ſeemelie in the ſight of God, and to beſtowe the ſame about the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornynge of her bodie, to make it gratious and liking to the eyes of men. And therfore ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be vtterly vnwilling, to folowe her mothers counſel in that point. When her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſawe, that her wordes and perſwaſion could take no place, ſhe was verie angrie with her, and ſent for her other daughter called <hi>Bonauentura,</hi> which was maried, and willed her to deale with her ſiſter, and to vſe all poſſible meanes to cauſe her to condeſcend to her requeſt. Who did as ſhe was willed by her mother, and in deed left no thing vn-aſſaied, wherby ſhe thought ſhe might wynne her purpoſe. And ſo in the end, what by the importunitie of the mother, and what by the example and faire ſpeach of <hi>Bonauentura</hi> (vnto whome <hi>Catherine</hi> had alwaies borne a ſpecial loue &amp; affection euen from her child hoold) the yong virgin was, as it were, enforced to yeald ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the folie, commonly receiued emong women, and ſo to ſpend ſome tyme more then ſhe was willing, about the attiere of her bodie. But afterwardes, when ſhe had retired her ſelfe from companie, and conſidered of the matter by her ſelfe alone, ſhe tooke meruelous great ſorowe for it, and was Confeſſed alſo for it, with ſuch ſobbing and ſighing, that anie man
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8350:19"/> would haue ſuppoſed, that ſhe had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome verie grieuous offence. She vſed often times to make a general Confeſſion of her whole life: and euermore when ſhe came to this point, ſhe could make no end of weeping and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. The which thing the Confeſſour percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, though he knewe, that it was a token of a timorous and well diſpoſed mynd, ſometymes to feare ſynne, where none is, yet bicauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſtrange to him, that ſhe ſhould haue a conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience of it, as of a mortall ſinne, wheras he by his learnyng, was fully reſolued, that in truth it was not ſo; he aſked her, whether ſhe had in all that tyme anie deliberate will and purpoſe, to doe anie thing contrary to her vowe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto ſhe anſwered and ſaid, that it neuer, came in her hart. Then he aſked her further more, whether ſhe did it to that end, that ſhe might be the better liked of men. To the which demaund, ſhee made aunſwere likewiſe and ſaid, that there was no one thing that grieued her more, then when ſhe was driuen, by anie neceſſarie occaſion, either to ſee, or to be ſeene of men, whom otherwiſe ſhe was wont to flee, like as men flee ſerpents; For the which cauſe ſhe would neuer ſtand at the doore or windowe, to ſee, or to be ſeene of men paſſing by the howſe. The Confeſſour proceded in examinyng the matter, and demaunded whether her attiere were ouer gaie, light, or otherwiſe exceſſiue, aboue that, that was commonly vſed of other
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8350:20"/> women of her degree. Wherunto ſhe anſwered &amp; ſaid, that it was not. Whie then (ſaid he) do yee take your offence to be ſo grieuous in the ſight of God? Sire (ſaid ſhe, ſobbing and ſighing from the botome of her hart) bicauſe I thinke, I did at that tyme preferre the loue of my ſiſter, before the loue of God: and whiles I was afraid to offend a ſilie tranſitorie creature, I offended the diuine maieſtie of the euerlaſting Creatour, and ſweet ſpowſe of my ſowle Ieſus Chriſt. And with that ſhe fell a weeping and wailing verie ruthfully, &amp; did great penance vpon her ſelfe. The which the Confeſſour ſeing, pitying her ſtate, and thinking it expedient to comfort her in that caſe, ſaid vnto her. Albeit there was ſome maner of exceſſe, yet conſidering that it was but litle, and done for no wicked or euel intent, but only for a vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance for that tyme, I take it, it was not againſt the commandement of God. When ſhe heard her Confeſſour ſaie ſo, ſhe lift vp her eyes to heauen, and cried with a lowd voice. Oh my Lord God, what a ghoſtlie Father is this, that excuſeth my ſinnes? And ſo with an earneſt diſpleaſure againſt her ſelfe, ſhe turned to her Confeſſour againe, and ſaid; Father, thinke you, that this moſt wretched and vile creature, which haue receiued ſo manie graces and gyftes of my Creatour, only of his more goodnes, without anie merite on my part, ſhould withdrawe anie tyme from the ſeruice of ſuch a louing and bowntiful Lord, and beſtowe the ſame about the ſetting out of this rotten and ſtincking
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8350:20"/> fleſh, which might alſo be a cauſe, or inducement, to deadlie ſynne? When the Confeſſour hard thoſe wordes, and ſawe that they proceeded from a hart wonderfully inflamed with the fyer of Gods loue, being not able to anſwere her, he gaue ouer to ſpeake of that matter anie more. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles he proceded to examine the whole ſtate of her life. And when he had done in that behalfe, ſo much as apperteined to a learned and diſcrete ghoſtlie Father to doe, he gaue afterwardes a verie ſufficient teſtimonie before God and his holie Church, that, when he had heard her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, both general and ſpeciall, all the tyme of his life, he could neuer eſpie anie ſpot of mortall ſynne in her conſcience, vnleſſe this be taken for a mortal ſynne, which no learned diuine (I thinke) would euer iudge. He teſtified furthermore both by word of mowth and in writing, that he found her alwaies ſo cleane from venial ſynnes, that he could ſcantlie perceiue by her Confeſſion (which ſhe made both verie often and verie exactely) that ſhe did commit anie offence at all: in ſo much that it was well knowen, not only to her ghoſtlie Father that examined her conſcience, but alſo to as manie, in effecte as had anie conuerſation or doinges with her, that ſhe did neuer, or ſeeldome offend ſo much as in word. And ſo will anie man iudge, that ſhall with good diligence, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, read ouer the whole ſtorie of her life. For he ſhall ſee, that the order of her life was ſuch, her ſilence ſo wonderful, her ſleepe ſo ſhort, her eating

This <hi>Bonauentura</hi> was euer of good life, and conuerſation: and yet, bicauſe ſhe had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to drawe her ſiſter from the ſeruice of God (to whom only ſhe had wholly deuoted her ſelfe) and to allure her to the vanities of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde, it pleaſed God to ſhewe this dreadful exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vpon her, for the terrour of all ſuch, as ſhould at anie tyme afterwardes be meanes to hinder holie vowes and purpoſes. And yet would he not haue her to be vtterly loſt: but (as it was reuealed afterwardes to this holie virgin, and ſhe declared the ſame ſecretly to her ghoſtlie Father) ſhe was in Purgatorie, and there abode manie grieuous paines and tormentes, for a long ſeaſon, and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould haue done, if this bleſſed virgin, had not hopen her with her deuout praiers. Now when her ſiſter <hi>Bonauentura</hi> was thus paſſed out of the wordle, this deuout maid, being by her departure, deliuered from that importunate cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which was before verie troubleſome vnto her, began to ſee more cleerly, both the deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of her ſynne, and the vanitie of the wordle. Wherupon, with an humble knowledge of her ſelfe, and ſure affiance in the mercie of God, ſhe caſt her ſelfe downe at the feet of our Lord
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8350:22"/> with <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> and there lying proſtrate with much lamentation and teares, beſought him of pardon for her offence, and would neuer geue ouer her weeping and wailing, but continued ſtil her moſt humble ſute, that ſhe alſo might at the lenght heare thoſe comfortable wordes, ſpoken by our Lord to her hart; <hi>Thy ſinnes are forgeuen thee:</hi> And from that daie foreward ſhe began to beare a ſpecial loue and deuotion to the ſaid <hi>Marie Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and to conforme her ſelfe to her in the workes of penance. It can not be expreſſed with wordes, what inward griefe of mynd ſhee tooke, ſo often as that offence came to her mynd. She ſighed and ſobbed, ſhe wept and wrang her handes, ſhe tooke no comfort in anie thing but only in the endles mercie of God, of the which ſhe made her ſelfe well aſſewred, that it did infinitely paſſe all the ſinnes, that anie man doth, or can commit, and that it was alwaies freely offred to as manie, as would require it, with a contrite and humble hart: wherupon ſhe ſequeſtred her ſelfe from all creatures, which (ſhe ſawe) were void of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, and turned her ſelfe to God, in whom only ſhe fownd her ſelfe to receiue perfecte and ſownd comfort. With him ſhe ſought by all meanes, to make her peace and attonement, &amp; ſo that made, to ſet her whole loue and felicitie in him. But the ghoſtlie enemie of mankind, enuying the blisful ſtate of this goodlie peace, did his endeuour to diſturbe the ſame, by putting into the myndes of her parentes and kinsfolke, how expedient it

But when the wiſe virgin ſawe by the light of Gods holie ſpirite, that all that, was but the ſutteltie of the deuel, meanyng therby to withdrawe her from her holie purpoſe, ſhe contrarie wiſe ſet her ſelfe more earneſtly, then ſhe was wont, to continual praiers, heauenlie meditations, and other workes of auſteritie and penance. She eſchewed the ſight, and conuerſation of men, and gaue all her frindes to vnderſtand plainely, that ſhe would haue no earthlie creature for her husband, but only the euerlaſting Sonne of God, vpon whom ſhe had fixed her loue. The which reſolution when her father and mother vnderſtood, they thought good to take an other waie; which was, to ſend for one of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Friars, whoſe authoritie, they thought, ſhe would reuerence, and to intreat him to talke with her, and to ſee if he could by anie meanes alter her mynd. The Friar came, and promiſed to doe what in him laie: and ſo did in deed. He ſet out vnto her in manie wordes, what auſteritie of life belonged to that profeſſion, that ſhe mynded to enter into, what a hard matter it was to hold out in the ſame, what ſnares the deuel would laie to entrappe her, how the wordle,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8350:23"/> would vſe manie meanes to circumuent &amp; flatter her, how fraile and weak the fleſh was, what a great danger and ſhame it would be, if when ſhe had once put her hand to the plough, ſhe ſhould looke backe againe. Vnto the which pointes, the faithful ſpowſe of Chriſt, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſuch wiſedome and conſtancie, that the religious man, which came to turne her, was turned him ſelfe: and ſo, being ſorie that he had waded ſo farre with her in that courſe, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his ſtile, and ſaid theſe wordes Daughter, ſeeing it is ſo, that yee are fully reſolued to ſerue God in the holie ſtate of virginitie, and that yee are therunto called (as I am thoroughly perſwaded by your wordes) euen by God him ſelfe: I haue no more to ſaie in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: it is the beſt part, that yee haue choſen: our Lord geue you grace to folowe it. And now, if yee thinke good furthermore to folowe my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, I would aduiſe you to cut off your haire; For in ſo doing, it is like, yee ſhall both cut of all hope of mariage in your parentes, and withal redeme a great deale of tyme and labour, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt needes be ſpent about the trymmyng of the ſame. When the holie virgin heard thoſe wordes, ſhe tooke them as ſpoken by God him ſelfe, and foorthwith ſhe ranne, and tooke a payre of ſheares, and cut of her haire hard by the ſkyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; For ſhe had before, conceiued a certaine diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt her haire, bicauſe ſhe perſwaded her ſelfe, that by the trymmyng of the ſame,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8350:23"/> ſhe had committed a grieuous offence againſt God. And when ſhe had ſo done, ſhe couered her head with a coyfe, and ſo went about her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines, contrarie to the maner of all other maide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. The which when her mother eſpied, ſhe aſked her what that coife meant. Wherunto ſhe made no direct anſweere, bicauſe ſhe was afraid to tell the truth, and to make a lie ſhe had a great conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience. Whereupon her mother ſtept haſtely vnto her, and taking of the kerchefe from her head, ſawe that her faire haire was cut of hard by the head. The which ſight and loſſe, ſo pinched her by the hart, that for verie inward griefe ſhe cried out. Alas daughter, ſaid ſhe, what haſt thou done? But the maid couered her head againe, and went aſide. At this crie of the mother came the good man of the howſe, and his other children, hauing great feare and wonder, what the matter ſhould be. But when they vnderſtood the cauſe, they were verie much offended with her: in ſo much that they reproached her, both in wordes and deedes. Thou vile wretche (ſaid they) troweſt thou thus, by cutting of thyne haire, to eſcape our handes? It will grewe againe in ſpite of thy teeth. Though thou burſt for curſt hart, thou muſt marrie. And make thy ſelfe well aſſured of this, thou ſhalt neuer haue good daie, vntill thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thy will to our will. And with that they tooke order, that ſhe ſhould haue no more anie ſecret chamber in the howſe to reſort vnto,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8350:24"/> but ſhould be continually occupied about the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruice of the howſe, that ſhe might haue, neither tyme nor place, to retire her ſelfe to praier and meditation. And to geue her to vnderſtand, how litle account they made of her, they put awaie the kitchen maide, and appointed her to doe, all the workes of drudgerie about the howſe. And while ſhe was ſo occupied, they ceaſed not to reuile her, whether ſoeuer ſhe went in the howſe, and to loade her eares with moſt opprobrious and deſpiteful wordes, weenyng therby to bring to paſſe, that ſhe ſhould either yeald to them, or be weerie of her life. Laſt of all, to enforce this battaile vpon the ſeelie maid with as great ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth and policie as was poſſible, they fownd out a comelie yonge man, of a good kinred, and welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued of all that were in the howſe, whom they tendered vnto her. But her hart was ſo thoroughly poſſeſſed with the loue of Chriſt her choſen ſpowſe, that ſhe might not abide to heare of any other. And wheras they had debarred her of that commoditie, which ſhe was wonte to haue, of a ſecret place to withdrawe her ſelfe vnto, for praier and meditation: our merciful Lord, who will not ſuffer his faithful ſeruantes to be tempted aboue that they are able, but euen with the tentation geueth an iſſue, taught her by the inward inſtincte of his holie ſpirite, how ſhe ſhould buyld a ſecret chamber, or oratorie in her owne hart, where ſhe might dwell delitefully with her ſweet ſpowſe ſo long as ſhe liſted, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8350:24"/> neuer be plucked out, whatſoeuer befell. And wheras before, ſhe was enforced ſometymes by occaſions to goe out of her chamber, and ſo to be diſtracted with out ward affaires, now contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe ſhut vp her ſelfe ſo cloſely in this cloſet, and tooke ſuch paſſing delite in the preſence of her loue and ioye, Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe delite it is to dwell in pure and cleane hartes, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they cried and called about her, whatſoeuer beating and bounſing they made outwardly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching her in wordes or deedes, ſhe paſſed with all ſuch thinges ſo quietly, as if they had neuer ben ſpoken or done to her. And thus had ſhe a verie ſenſible, and experimental vnderſtanding of that goodly leſſon, which our Sauiour teacheth vs in the ghoſpel, where he ſaieth: <hi>The kingdome of God is within you.</hi> For vnto a ſowle thus diſpoſed, where Chriſt reigneth by faith and holie loue, all creatures are made vaſſal, and do ſerue ech thing in his kind and courſe orderly, euen as obedient ſubiectes do their Prince, in a well gouerned kingdome. Now when this towardlie diſciple of Chriſt, had thus learned this high leſſon, by the teaching of the holie Ghoſt, as ſhe had ſhewed her ſelfe to be an humble ſcholer in the ſchoole of God, ſo had ſhe alſo a charitable deſire to become a diſcrete ſchoole-miſtres to others, and namely to Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> her ghoſtlie Father, whom at tymes, when he was occaſioned to goe abroad, by reaſon of his charge and affaires, ſhe would warne, that he ſhould buyld a ſecret cell, or cloſet,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:8350:25"/> in his ſowle, out of the which he ſhould neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. The which wordes, at the firſt, ſeemed to him to be verie obſcure and darcke: but afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, when he had conſidered of them aduiſedly, he ſawe, that they were to verie good purpoſe and profit. He ſawe, what a goodlie thing it was, for a man to buyld a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple in his hart for almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, and to dwell in the ſame with quietnes of conſcience, and peace of God, that paſſeth all vnderſtanding. And he ſawe, how litle the deuel had gayned at this holie virgins hand, by mouing her parentes, to debarre her of that litle commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie of a ſecret chamber, which ſhe had in their howſe. The loſſe wherof was an occaſion to her, to buyld an heauenlie chamber in her hart, where ſhe might enioye the ſweet preſence of her louelie ſpowſe, ſo often, and ſo long as ſhe liſted, without anie trouble or moleſtation. And as for the abba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of her, to the vile ſeruices of the howſe, how litle that turned to the aduantage of the enemie, it may appeere by that, that ſhe her ſelfe declared afterwardes to her ghoſtlie Father. When ſhe ſawe, that her father and mother had appointed her to doe all the workes of drudgerie in the kitchen, and other places of the howſe, ſhe neuer repined at it, but turned all that baſenes to her great commoditie &amp; merite, by this holie imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. She had this conceite with her ſelfe, that her father, repreſented in the howſe, our Sauiour Chriſt; her mother our bleſſed Lady; her brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſiſters, and others of the familie, the Apoſtles and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8350:25"/> diſciples of Chriſt. The kitchen ſhe imagined to be the innermoſt tabernacle of the temple called <hi>Sancta ſanctorum,</hi> where the moſt principal burnt ſacrifices, were dight and offred vp to God. And with this godlie imagination, ſhe went vp and downe the howſe like a diligent <hi>Martha,</hi> and in her father, mother, and brethren ſerued Chriſt, with his bleſſed mother &amp; Sainctes, ſo cheerefully and with ſuch a glad hart, that the whole howſe had great wonder of it. And thus ſhe turned all that drudgerie, wherunto ſhe was put by the malice of the ghoſtlie enemie, to the honour of God, to the inward comfort of her owne ſowle, and to the great contentation of her parentes, and edifying of as manie as ſawe it.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8350:26"/> might not haue, bicauſe her father and mother had taken order to the contrarie: ſhe choſe to be in her brother <hi>Steuens</hi> chamber, where ſhe might in the daie tyme, withdrawe her ſelfe from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, whiles he was out of the waie, and in the night, ſet her ſelfe to praier, without feare of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, when he was laid to ſleepe. So that night and daie, ſhe ſought none other thing, but how ſhe might occupie her ſelfe in ſuch vertuous exerciſes, as were moſt liking to her heauenlie ſpowſe, vnto whom ſhe commended her ſelfe and praied without ceaſing, that it would pleaſe him to be the keeper of her virginitie, ſaying euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with the glorious virgin and martyr <hi>Cecilia:</hi> O Lord, let my hart and bodie be kept vndefiled. And our Lord, who neuer faileth to ſuccour his faithful ſeruantes in their diſtreſſe, heard the crie his vniuſtly afflicted ſpowſe, and gaue her ſuch ſtrenght and comfort from aboue, that ſhe bare &amp; ouercame with great facilitie, all that heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of vexations and troubles, that her parents and kinsfolkes had laid vpon her. And the greater enforcement they vſed, to remoue her from her holie purpoſe, the more firme and vnmoueable ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be in continuyng the ſame. In ſo much that at the lenght, when her parentes ſawe her firmenes and conſtancie, they confeſſed, and ſaid in plaine wordes. She hath ouercome vs. And her father, who was more innocent then the reſt, conſidering ſecretly with him ſelfe, of the doinges of his daughter, perceiued euerie daie
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8350:26"/> more &amp; more that ſhe folowed in the whole ſtate of her life, not anie lightnes of youth, or ſtubbernes of hart towardes her parents, but only the motion and guidance of Gods holie ſpirite. For the better confirmation wherof, it pleaſed God ſo to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that on a daie, when ſhe was in her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chamber at praier, leauing the doore open (for her father &amp; mother had geuen her charge, that ſhe ſhould be no where, with the doore ſhut vpon her) her father in the meane tyme entring into the chamber by chaunce, &amp; ſeekyng ſome thing there, of his ſonnes, that he had need to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie at that tyme, fownd her in a corner knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling deuoutly vpon her knees; and caſting vp his eyes, ſawe a litle white doue, ſitting ouer her head; which doue, ſo ſoone as he was entred, to his ſeemyng, flewe out at the chamber windowe; wherat being ſomewhat amazed, he aſked her, what doue that was. Sir, ſaid ſhe, I neuer ſawe doue, nor other byrd in the chamber, that I wote of. The which when he heard, he was verie much aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but kept the matter ſecretly to him ſelfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this tyme, the deſire, which this holie virgin had had of long tyme, to put on the habit of <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> began to increaſe in her hart, daily mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re &amp; more: for the accompliſhment wherof, ſhe ceaſed not by daie &amp; by night, to offer vp her humble praiers and ſupplications to almightie God. Who liked well of her requeſt, &amp; graunted the ſame: therfore for her better aſſurance &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, ſent her this ſtrange and euident viſion.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:8350:27"/> Being on a tyme a ſleepe, it ſeemed that ſhe ſawe, diuerſe and ſundrie of the Fathers and fownders, of the rules of religion: and emong them, ſhe ſawe <hi>S.

Thoſe Fathers willed her, to chooſe ſome one of their rules, in the which, ſhe might lead her life, and ſerue God, with the greater merite. She caſt her eyes vpon <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> and turned her ſelfe whole to him: who likewiſe came towardes her, bringing in his hand the habite of the ſiſters, commonly called, the ſiſters Penitentes of <hi>S. Dominicke:</hi> and ſaid thus vnto her. Daughter, ſaid he, be of good comfort, and dread no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril; for it is certaine, that thou ſhalt receiue this apparel and weare it. The which wordes, were ſo comfortable vnto her, that ſhe wept for ioye, and gaue moſt humble thankes to almi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghtie God, and to the worthie patriarcke <hi>S. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicke.</hi> And ſo with the force of teares guſhing out of her eyes, ſhe awaked, and came to her ſelfe againe. By this viſion ſhe receiued ſuch comfort and ſtrength, both in bodie and ſowle, and withal ſuch a truſt and affiance in God; that the ſelfe ſame daie, ſhe called her father, and mother, &amp; brethren together, and ſpake vnto them with a great grace, and comelie boldnes, after this maner. It is now a long tyme, ſence yee firſt began to treat with me, that I ſhould marrie with ſome mortal man; The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8350:27"/> which talke how much I euer abhored, I neuer declared plainely, but concealed it in part, for reuerence that I bare vnto you. But now I may no longer hold my peace: and therfore I mynd to open my hart and purpoſe vnto you in plaine wordes. It is ſo, that I haue made a full reſolution and promiſe to my Lord and Sauiour, and to his moſt glorious Mother the bleſſed virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> that I will ſerue them all the daies of my life, in the cleane and holie ſtate of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie; And I geue you to vnderſtand, that this is no newe thing, or lately come vpon me, but a thing that I did long ſince, euen in myne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie, being not with ſtanding therunto mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, not by anie childiſh lightnes, but by long and ſad aduiſement; and that, not without verie euident tokens, and moſt aſſured reuelations from almightie God. And I haue vowed withal, that I will neuer incline myne hart, to accept anie other husband, but only him. And therfore now, being come by his gratious goodnes, to the yeares of diſcretion, and more perfite knowledge, I thought it my bownden duetie, to aduertiſe you in expreſſe termes, that thus much I haue, by the will of God faithfully promiſed, and thus much I will by the grace of God, truly obſerue, This determinate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, is ſo deepely imprinted in my ſowle, that it ſhalbe more eaſie to make a hard flint ſofte, then to take this godlie reſolution out of myne hart. Wherfore I moſt humbly beſeech you,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8350:28"/> that yee wil leeſe no more tyme, in treating with me about mariage; For in this matter, I maie in no wiſe, condeſcend to your requeſt, bicauſe I haue plight my faith and truth, to Ieſus Chriſt alone, whoſe loue I doe, and muſt preferre before all earthlie creatures, Now, if it ſhall pleaſe you to keepe me in your houſe, with this condicion, as your common ſeruant, I will ſerue you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and obediently, to the vttermoſt of my power. If yee thinke by putting me out of your howſe, to enforce me to yeald vnto your demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for lacke of neceſſarie prouiſion, aſſure your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, no feare of lacke can alter my mynd in this caſe. For I haue choſen him for my husband, that geueth foode to al liuing creatures, who will not ſuffer them to be deſtitute of thinges neceſſarie, that repoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with a ſure affiance in his prouident goodnes. With theſe wordes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with ſuch a comelie grace &amp; modeſtie, they were all ſo aſtoined, &amp; withal ſo ouercome with tendernes of hart and weeping, that for a good ſpace they were not able to geue her one word for anſwere. At the lenght, her father, who was a man that feared God, and had a more Chriſtian conſideration of thinges, then the reſt had, calling to mynd the Doue, which he had ſeene not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before ouer her head, with diuerſe &amp; ſundrie other the like verie euident tokens of ſome ſtrange grace, and fauour of God towardes her, after a good ſeaſon, when he had wonne ſo much of him ſelfe, that he was able to ſpeake,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8350:28"/> made her this anſwere. Deere Daughter, ſaid he God forbid, that we ſhould will, or deſire anie, thinge, contrarie to the will of God, from whom (we doubt not) this holie determination of yours proceedeth. Your long patience and conſtancie, declare vnto vs verie euidently, that this your deſignement cometh, not of anie childiſh lightnes, but of a feruent loue towardes God. Doe therfore a Gods name freely, what you haue vowed: folowe the waie, that the holie Ghoſt ſheweth vnto you. From this daie foreward we ſhall no more hinder you, but ſhall confourme our willes to the will of God. Only this, praie hartely for vs to your ſpowſe, whom yee haue choſen in your tender age, that we may after his life be fownd worthie of the bliſſe, that he hath promiſed vs. Then turnyng to his wife, and other children, he ſaid likewiſe to them. From this daie foreward, ſee that none of you be ſo hardie, as to moleſt or hinder my Daughters deuotion. Let her ſerue her ſpowſe with all diligence and freedome: for in truth this alliance, that ſhe hath made, is both more honorable, and alſo more for the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our familie, then that was, that we ſought to make; We haue no cauſe to complaine of her doinges? The exchange, that ſhe hath made, is this; She hath refuſed to match with a mortal man, and hath choſen to be maried, to the immortal God and man, Ieſus Chriſt, the redeemer of the wordle. When the father had ſpoken theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, not without manie teares, both in him ſelfe,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8350:29"/> and in others that were there preſent, and name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the mother, who bare a verie tender and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural loue to this daughter, the ioyous virgin, whoſe hart, was as it were rauiſhed with vnſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akeable gladnes, yealded moſt humble thankes; Firſt to almightie God, by whoſe gracious aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhe had ouercome this battaile; then to her father and mother, for their moſt comfortable graunt made vnto her: &amp; from that hower fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſhe had none other care in her hart, but how ſhe might beſt directe her life wholye to the honour of her deere ſpowſe.</p>

                  <p>AFter that her parentes had made her this graunt of freedome to ſerue God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie hinderance or moleſtation: ſhe began foorthwith to diſpoſe her life after a meruelous goodlie order. And firſt of all ſhe beſought them, that ſhe might haue ſome litle chamber to her ſelfe (which was graunted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie difficultie) in the which, what rigorous diſcipline, and auſterite, ſhe exerciſed vpon her bodie, with what diligence and carefulnes, ſhe ſought to haue the deliteful preſence of her ſpowſe, no tongue is able to expreſſe. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſhe to renewe the exerciſes of the auncient Fathers in Egipt: which wer the more meruelous in her, bicauſe they were done without anie example, or inſtruction of man, by a fraile woman, in her tender age, not in a wood, caue, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8350:29"/> ſolitarie place, but in a citie, not in a couent of Nonnes, but in her fathers howſe. At the verie entrie therfore into this ſtreight maner of life, firſt and foremoſt ſhe reſolued vtterly to abſteine from all fleſh: the which kind of abſtinence ſhe continued ſo preciſely, that at the length by long vſe and cuſtome, all fleſh became lothſome vnto her: in ſo much that it was euidently ſeene, that the only ſmell of it, was noyſome to her bodie. Wherby ſhe became verie leane, thynne, and feeble. Which thing her ghoſtlie Father per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing on a tyme, and knowing that the cauſe therof was, that ſhe receiued no meate or drincke, that was of good ſubſtance and nouriſhment, gaue her counſel, that ſhe ſhould put in her water, which ſhe dranke, a litle ſuger to comfort and quicken the ſpirites. Wherat ſhe was ſomewhat moued, and turnyng ſodainly to him, ſaid theſe wordes. That litle life, that is lefte in me, me thinketh, yee goe about to quench it vtterly. With that he began to examine her concernyng the order of her diet, and fownd by examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the wordes which ſhe ſpake, were verie true, for in deed ſhe had ſo accuſtomed her ſelfe to bitter meates, and vnſauorie drinkes, that all ſweet thinges were become hurtful to her bodie, forſomuch as her natural diſpoſition was altered by cuſtome. Her ordinarie drinke, from the begynning, was a litle portion of wyne (as the maner of that countrey is) myngled with ſo much water, that it loſt both taſt and ſauour,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8350:30"/> and a great part of the coulour alſo. But when ſhe was fiften yeares old, ſhe gaue ouer all wyne, and drancke water alone. She weaned her ſelfe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by litle and litle, from all maner of ſodden meates, and ſuſteined her bodie with bread only, and a fewe rawe herbes. After this, when ſhe was of the age of twentie yeares, or there about, ſhe gaue ouer the eating of bread alſo, and held her ſelfe to rawe herbes only. Laſt of all, ſhe came to ſuch a high ſtate of life (not by anie force of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the ſupernaturall power of God) that for a long tyme together, ſhe ſuſteined her life without eating and drinking at all, and yet en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured withal, willingly and cheerfully, both verie paineful ſickeneſſes, and alſo verie hard labours of the bodie. Moreouer and all this, it was certainly knowen, that her ſtomake had quite loſt the office and power of digeſtion: and yet, neither was that moiſture, which the phiſitians call Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical, conſummed, nor the ſtrenght of her fraile bodie anie iote decaied.

Now when her mother had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied that alſo, and ſawe that whatſoeuer ſhe coulde deuiſe, for the ſolace or comfort of her daughters bodie, was by her wilines turned to the contrarie, ſhe determined to returne to her howſe againe: where not withſtanding ſhe ceaſed not to ſhewe in wordes, that ſhe had a great miſliking, of her extreme ſeueretie and penance.

When the mother came home with this anſwere to her daughter, ſhe was nothing daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted withal, but beſought her mother, after a verie humble maner, that ſhe would take the paines to renewe her ſute againe, and vſe more earneſt meanes to perſwade with them, then ſhe had done before.

The which occaſion, the wiſe virgin thought, was not to be ſlipt: but taking the oportunitie of the preſent ſtate and tyme, began to moue her mother once againe after this maner. Good mother, as yee tender my life and health, ſo I beſeech you, to vſe diligent and earneſt meanes to procure me the habite, that I haue ſo long deſired; for otherwiſe I am well aſſured, that our Lord, and <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> who haue called me to their ſeruice, will ſo diſpoſe of me, that you ſhall not haue me long, neither in that habite, nor in anie other. Theſe wordes ſhe repeated ſo often, and with ſuch vehemencie, that her mother at the lenght, being verie ſore afraid, leſt her daughter ſhowld haue died in deed, went againe to the religious ſiſters, and intreated them ſo earneſtly, that they were ouercome with her importunitie, and ſo made her an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were after this maner. If your daughter (ſaid they) be not ouer-faire, we are content to receiue her. If ſhe be, the malice (ye knowe) of the wordle is ſuch, that you ſhal haſſard the good name, both of your daughter, and of all vs. And therfore we maie in no wiſe receiue her. Wherunto the mother anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered and ſaid. Come your ſelues and iudge, whether ſhe be faire or no.

Which coming to the howſe, fownd the maid lying ſicke on her bed, and by ſickenes ſo altered, that they might not well diſcerne the dipoſition of her bodie. Howbeit by her wordes, they ſawe verie euidently, that ſhe had a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous feruent deſire in her hart to ſerue God, wherat they were both verie much aſtoined, &amp; alſo verie glad, to ſee ſo yong a maid, to paſſe a nomber of auncient women, in vertue and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.

Theſe and other the like ſpeeches, ſhe would vſe at tymes, to ſtirre vp her ſelfe, to the better obſeruation of her godlie vowes, and deſignementes. And emong other thinges, ſhe determined to keepe a verie ſtrange, &amp; rigorous maner of ſilence; In ſo much that for the ſpace of three yeares, ſhe neuer ſpake with anie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but only with her ghoſtlie Father, &amp; with him ſhe ſpake only in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion, &amp; not otherwiſe. Out of her cell, ſhe neuer went, vnleſſe it were to the Church to heare Maſſe, or ſome other diuine ſeruice. And bicauſe ſhe began then to eate none other meate, but only bread, and rawe herbes, ſhe needed not to goe out for anie other prouiſion.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:8350:38"/> She determined neuer to goe to take anie repaſt, or bodilie ſuſtenance, without much weeping before: as though that had ben a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, to procure an appetite. After this maner ſhe fownd the meanes to find out a wildernes in the middle of the citie, and to make her ſelfe a ſolitarie place, were there was great reſort and concourſe of people. She continued in praier, &amp; meditation, in the night ſeaſon, vntill the Friars Preachers, rang the ſecond peale to Matins. And then ſhe went to take a litle reſt; ſaying theſe wordes to our Lord. Lord, hitherto haue thy ſeruantes my brethren taken their reſt, and I haue kept the watch for them, before thee our gardian, &amp; protectour, beſeeching thee to keepe them from the aſſaultes of the enemie, and all euel; Now are they riſen to praiſe thee: wherfor I humbly praie thee, to keepe them, and to geue me leaue to reſt a while; And ſo ſhe laid her ſelfe downe, vpon the bare boordes, and put vnder her head, a hard blocke, in ſteed of a bolſter or pillowe.</p>

                  <p>THis holie virgin, declared in ſecret confeſſion, to her ghoſtlie Father, that at what tyme ſhe began to retire her ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe from all conuerſation, and to liue alone in her
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8350:38"/> cell, it pleaſed her ſpowſe Ieſus Chriſt, to viſite her in viſible maner, and to geue her inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in matters concernyng her ſaluation. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid ſhe, take this for a moſt certaine truth, that I was neuer taught the rule of ſpiritual life, by anie man or woman, but only by Ieſus Chriſt, the ſpowſe of my ſowle: who hath informed me alwaies, either by ſecret inſpiration, or els appeering openly vnto me, and ſpeaking to me, as I now ſpeake to you. She declared moreouer to her ghoſtlie Father, that at the begyning, her viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s were for the moſt part, only wrought in her imagination; but afterwardes they were ſenſible: in ſo much that ſhe ſawe with her bodilie eyes, and heard with her bodilie eares, the ſownd of the voice, that ſpake vnto her. She reported furthermore, that at the begynning, ſhe began to doubt and feare, leſt it might be ſome deceite, or illuſion of the ghoſtlie enemie, who transfigureth him ſelfe into an Angel of light. Which feare our Lord miſliked not, but rather commended it highlie vnto her, and ſaid, that ſo long as a man or woman, liueth in this life, he ſhould alwaies ſtand in feare, according as it written. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, that is euer fearfull.</hi> And he aſked her, whether ſhe were willing, to learne of him certaine, notes and tokens, by the which ſhe might be able, to diſcerne betweene the true viſions of God, and the falſe illuſions of the enemie. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere, with great ſubmiſsion, and lowlines of ſpirite, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8350:39"/> beſought him humbly, that he would vowcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to teach her. Then he ſaid theſe wordes. Daughter, It were an eaſie matter for me, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thy ſowle inwardly, with the ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincte of my ſpirit, in ſuch ſort, that thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt at all tymes diſcerne perfectly and without errour, betweene true viſions, and counterfeicte illuſions. But bicauſe my will is, that it ſhould profit others, as well as thee: therfore I will teach thee a general rule and leſſon, which is this. My viſion beginneth euermore with feare and dread, but in proceſſe of tyme, it ſetteth a ſowle in great ioye, quietnes, and ſecuritie. It begynneth with ſome kind of bitternes, but in continuance it waxeth more deliteful &amp; ſweet. The viſions of the enemie, are contrarie; For in the begynning, they ſhewe a kind of ſecuritie and gladnes, but in proceſſe they turne to feare, and bitternes, which increaſe afterwardes, and waxe greater and greater. And it ſtandeth with good reaſon: for ſo much as my waies, and the waies of the enemie, haue this ſpecial differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce. My waies are the keeping of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dementes, in perfection of a vertuous and godlie life, which leadeth vnto me. Theſe ſeeme at the begynnyng, to be full of difficultie and vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: but in tyme, they become eaſie ynough, &amp; pleaſant. But the waies of the enemie, are the tranſgreſſing of my commaundementes, in the libertie of the fleſh, and licentiouſnes of life, which ſhewe at the begynnyng, to be deliteful,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8350:39"/> and pleaſant: but in continuance of tyme, they proue in verie deed, dangerous, painful, and vnpleaſant. Take this alſo, for a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and infallible rule, to diſcerne betweene true, and falſe viſions; Bicauſe I am truth, it can not otherwiſe be, but that euermore by my viſions, the ſowle of man muſt needes receiue a greater knowledge of truth: by the which knowledge he cometh to vnderſtand, both his owne baſenes, &amp; the worthines of God: and ſo conſequently, to doe due honour and reuerence to God, and to make litle account of him ſelfe; which is the proper condicion of humilitie. The contrarie happeneth in the viſions of the enemie; For he being the father of lying, and king ouer al the children of pride, can geue none other thing, but only what he hath: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his viſions there muſt needes enſue in a ſowle, ignorance, and errour: by reaſon wherof it conceiueth a falſe reputation of it ſelfe, which is the proper condicion of pride. By this maieſt thou knowe, whether thy viſions be of me, or of the enemie, of truth, or of falſhood. If they come of truth, they will make thy ſowle humble: if they come of falſhood, they will make thy ſowle prowd. Thus was ſhe inſtructed of the teacher of all truth, Ieſus Chriſt: and ſhe kept his doctrine and inſtructions, verie faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in mynd, and vttered them afterwardes to her ghoſtlie Father, and others, for their inſtruction, as it ſhalbe declared hereafter.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8350:40"/> And after this time it pleaſed God to ſend her ſo manie viſions, and reuelations, that who ſo would conſider of them aduiſedly, he ſhould ſee, that it were hard to find, anie two men in the wordle, more familiary acquenited, then our Lord and ſhe were. In ſo much that whether ſhe praied, or read, or meditated, or walked, or waked, or ſlept, ſhe was at all tymes, and in all places, viſited, and comforted of our Lord. And which is more, while her tongue was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſpeaking vnto men, her hart was inwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly bent vpon God, and ſpake, ſpiritually with him. Howbeit that could not endure anie long tyme: forſomuch as her ſowle was within a litle ſpace, ſo drawen vp and vnited to God, that it could not chooſe, but forſake vtterly, the ſenſes and powers of the bodie.</p>

                  <p>EMongeſt a nomber of goodlie and high leſſons, that ſhe learned of our Sauiour, this was one. On a tyme, while ſhe was praying, our Sauiour appeered to her, and ſaid. Daughter, knoweſt thou what thou art, and what I am? If thou haue a perfecte knowledge of theſe two pointes, thou art bleſſed. For by the meane therof, thou ſhalt eaſily eſcape all the ſnares of the enemie, and ſhalt not at anie tyme,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8350:40"/> geue conſent to anie ſynne, that is againſt my commaundementes: but contariwiſe, thou ſhalt be able to atteine to all grace, all truth, all cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie without anie great difficultie or hardnes. This is a briefe doctrine, by the which a man may, without reading manie bookes, without diſcuſsing manie ſuttle, and perplexed poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of philoſophie, be made bleſſed, and vnite him ſelfe with God. Full well did my ſeruant <hi>Augustine</hi> vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d this, when he ſaied. O Lord, when I knowe thee, and when I knowe my ſelfe, then haue I obteined the frute of all my praier. Verie fewe atteine, to the perfecte vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this matter: and therfore geue thou good heed to my wordes, that thou maieſt be made able to conceiue it. Thou art ſhe, that art not. Is not this true? Art not thou ſhe, that was made of nothing? In ſo much as euerie creature is made of nothing: and ſo hauing no maner of being of it ſelfe, it begynneth to haue a being, by my almightie power, to witt, what ſoeuer is, it is by me, and not by it ſelfe. And therfore of it ſelfe, it tendeth euermore to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againe, that is, to haue no being. And if I ſhould withdrawe my hand, that conſerueth it, but for the ſpace of one moment, it would foorthwith turne to be, as it was of it ſelfe, that is, nothing. Now bicauſe ſynne is a defecte, and ſo conſequently nothing: therfore man (vnleſſe the hand of God did alwaies preſerue him) would of him ſelfe, tend vnto ſynne, and ſo
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8350:41"/> to al maner of defect. This is the doctrine, which I taught my diſciples, when I ſaid; <hi>VVithout me yee can doe nothing.</hi> And by the mowthe of myne Apoſtle; <hi>He that taketh himſelfe to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, when he is nothing, deceiueth him ſelfe.</hi> And in an other place; <hi>VVe are not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to thinke anie thing of our ſelues, as of our ſelues, but our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> Be thou therfore wel aſſured, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you are, that are you by my creation, and by my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the which it may be ſaid after a ſort, that I doe as it were, create you againe and againe, from tyme to tyme, and geue you a newe being euerie moment. And knowe thou alſo for an vndoubted truth; that as of your ſelues you are nothing, ſo of your ſelues you do euermore tend to nothing. Now if a man were thoroughly perſwaded in this truth, to witt, if a man were fully reſolued, that in truth he were nothing, how could he be prowd? How could he glorie in him ſelfe, or in anie worke of his owne, if he knewe, that there were nothing properly his owne, but only defectes and ſynne? How could he vaunt, and ſet him ſelfe before others, if he did conſider with good aduiſement, that he were equal with all others, to witt, nothing, as al others be? How could he beare enuie to any other, or diſdaine the ſtate of anie man, or woman in the wordle, if he ſawe cleerely, that all goodnes were of God, and all euell of him ſelfe? And (if he tooke theſe growndes to be true) how could he put his hope
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8350:41"/> and affiance, in anie man or other earthlie thing? How could he be brought to ſaie, or to thinke, that this thing is myne, if he were reſolued, that it is God that hath made, it and not him ſelfe, who (as of him ſelfe) is nothing? And none can geue that to an other, that he hath not him ſelfe. He that hath not his being of him ſelfe, but hath receiued the ſame of an other by waie, as it were, of petition and beggyng, can not impart it vnto anie other. And therfore the creature that knoweth this, accounteth him ſelfe vile and baſe, and full of defectes, and may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, on all ſides. The which conceit cauſeth, that he can not loue anie thing in him ſelfe, bicauſe he ſeeth, that there is but one thing properly, and truly, to be accounted his owne, which is ſynne. But bicauſe, man ſtanding in theſe termes, ſhould fall awaie, and liue in a wretched kind of deſpaire (forſomuch as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally he is inclined to haue a being) therefore, the other part of this doctrine is verie requiſite to be vnderſtood, which is, that I am he, that am: as it was ſaid to <hi>Moyſes,</hi> in the viſion of the buſh, that burned &amp; was not conſumed. In truth that thing is that is of it ſelfe. And that thing only is of it ſelfe, whoſe being dependeth not of anie other, nor hath anie ſuperior cauſe, which thing is only God. All other creatures, haue their being of God, in ſo much as they are created, &amp; conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him. God only, is vnchangable, incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, and cauſe of his owne euerlaſting being.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8350:42"/> That creature therefore, that ſeeth this, and hath a natural deſire of being; when he ſeeth, that he can not haue anie being, and much leſſe anie good, and bleſſed being, in him ſelfe, or in anie other creature; he turneth him ſelfe to God, with an humble, and deuout mynd, and ſetting him ſelfe to contemplate and behold his Creator and Conſeruer, the geuer, mainteiner, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſer of all being, and bleſſednes, the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting founteine and ſpring of all goodnes, which only is able to ſlake, the thyrſt of all his natural luſtes and longynges, he begynneth to ſigh towardes him, and knowing him to be a moſt liberal and bowntifull geuer, he is infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the loue of him, and ſo much the more, bicauſe he ſeeth, that of all the gyftes, and benefits, that he receiueth at his hand, there returneth no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie to the geuer againe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as he is in him ſelfe, and of him ſelfe, the moſt high, perfecte, and ſufficient goodnes. And thus encreaſing in knowledge, he cometh to vnderſtand, that as it is he that geueth and extolleth, ſo it is he alſo, that taketh awaie and abaſeth, when his pleaſure is. Wherupon he conceiueth, a certaine holie feare, which is the gardian of the ſowle: by reaſon wherof he will not ſuffer anie thing to paſſe from his hart, that maie offend, ſo ſweet, and bowntifull a geuer. And withal he ſetleth him ſelfe, ſo faſt vpon his prouident goodnes, that whatſoeuer trouble, or aduerſitie, befall him, he is nothing
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8350:42"/> moued withal, but knoweth for certaine, that almightie God, permitteth it to come vpon him, for his ſaluation, either for his further inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to make him to looke better to him ſelfe, or to increaſe his merite, or els as a iuſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſome offence committed. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reouer, this conſideration bringeth him to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there is no labour, no trauaile, no affliction in this wordle ſo grieuous, that maie in anie degree, ſeeme worthie of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reward, that he looketh for at the moſt bountifull hand of God. And therefore he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more to him ſelfe, but only to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull goodnes of God: in whom repoſing him ſelfe, with a verie ſure affiance, and ſweet loue, he receiueth, euen in this preſent life, a pledge and earneſt pennie, of the life to come. This was the firſt leſſon, that the bleſſed virgin, learned of her ſpowſe and maiſter: the which ſhe tooke of him verie willingly, like a towardly ſcholer, and laid it vp verie charily, in the cheſt of her hart. This was the ſure foundation, that the great workeman laid in the ſowle of his deere ſpowſe, vpon the which he mynded to make a perfecte buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life.</p>

The which wordes ſhe tooke to be ſpoken in like ſenſe (as ſhe declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to her ghoſtlie Father) as if our Lord had ſaid in plaine wordes vnto her. Daughter, haue no thought or care of thy ſelfe, neither bodily, nor ghoſtly; for I, that knowe what is behoueful for thee, better then thou doſt thy ſelfe, will thinke vpon thee, and prouide with all care and diligence, for thy neceſſities. Only ſet thou thy ſelf to thinke on me, for in that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thy perfection and final bliſſe. This is a great leſſon, and vndoubtedly verie profitable to him, that would exerciſe it faithfully. For the will of God towardes vs (as the Apoſtle ſaieth) is our ſanctification, which conſiſteth in vniting our ſelues to him by loue: which loue ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be wrought in our willes, vnleſſe our hart be wholly diſcharged, of the cares of all earth lie thinges. Forſomuch as God is a thing of ſuch
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8350:43"/> excellencie, that he deſerueth, to diſpoſſeſſe our hart of all other thinges, that him ſelfe maie enter, &amp; take poſſeſſion of it as the only rightful Lord, and owner of the ſame. But bicauſe he ſeeth, that we ſtand in need of manie thinges, for the preſeruation of our bodie, which if we haue not prouided from tyme to tyme, it muſt needes decaie: therefore he added furthermore, and ſaid: and I will thinke on thee. Which wordes import ſo much, as thoſe that he ſpake to his diſciples, when he willed them, to be careles for all earthlie thinges, aperteinyng to the maintenance of the bodie, and to ſet their whole hope and affiance, in his prouident good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. For if it be ſo, that he prouideth ſo dwely, for the neceſſarie ſuſtentation of byrdes in the aier, of beaſtes, and wormes in the earth, and of all other liuing thinges; if he haue ſuch a fatherlie care to clad the verie trees, plantes, flowers, and other inſenſible creatures: how much greater care is it like, that he will haue of man (for whoſe ſake all theſe creatures were made) as being the moſt excellent creature, made vnto the image of God, &amp; ſpecially chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue the ioyfull fruition of him ſelfe? She reaſoned furthermore with Church men, &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with Prieſtes, and religious perſons after this maner. Seing it is ſo, ſaid ſhe, that we haue made a full reſignatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſelues vnto God, firſt in Baptiſme, and afterwardes when we entred into holie Orders, or tooke vpon vs the ſtate of a

And that we muſt doe, not only in reſpecte of the reward, that we looke for at his hand, but ſpecially and principally, in conſideration of the worthines, of that bleſſed band of loue and vnion, which is betweene vs and him. In ſo much that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſtate of life euerlaſting, is to be deſired of vs, not ſo much for it ſelfe, as bicauſe it vniteth vs perfectly, and inſeparably, to our begynning and original being, which is almightie God. It can not be expreſſed in wordes, what a great affiance, this holie maid conceiued, of thoſe wordes of our Sauiour (And I will thinke on thee); in the which wordes, ſhe tooke ſuch a paſſing ioye and delite, that ſhe could neuer haue her fill, of thinking and ſpeaking of them.

For you to take care for theſe thinges, is to take from God, his care and prouidence: as though he either would not, or could not, prouide for you in all caſes. Knowe you not, that he hath a greater care of you, then you haue of your ſelues? And that he is both able, and willing to award you from all euels? It chaunced on a tyme, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> and manie other both men and women, were in a ſhip on the ſea, emong whom was this holie maid alſo: and when the night came on, they were in great peril (as the pilote ſaid) to be caried, for lacke of a good wind, into ſtrange ylandes, and farre countries.

With that Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> held his peace, &amp; tooke a better comfort. And anon after, there blewe a contrarie wind, which enforced the pilote (as he ſaid) to returne back againe, which thing her ghoſtlie Father went and declared vnto her alſo. Wherunto ſhe ſaid: Let him turne the ſhip a Gods name, and folowe the wind that God ſendeth. And ſo he did: and ſhe in the meane tyme, bowed downe her head, and made her praier to God. And they kept not on that

A ſowle (ſaid ſhe) that loueth God perfectly, neuer ſeeth, loueth, or remembreth, anie other creature, neither it ſelfe, nor anie other thing. The which ſaying, ſhe declared more plainely after this maner. Such a ſowle, ſaid ſhe, ſeeth that of it ſelfe it is nothing, and that all her being, and welfare, dependeth of God only: in whom ſhe findeth by experience, that al her felicitie ſtandeth, and in none other creature: and therfore ſhe wholly forſaketh, both her ſelfe, and all other thinges, &amp; doth as it were, plonge her ſelfe in the loue of him, and directeth all her workes, and thoughtes, together with all the powers of her ſowle in him, according to the rule and direction, that ſhe findeth in him.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:8350:45"/> And without him, ſhe liſteth not to be, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as in him ſhe findeth, all that the hart maie delite in, all beautie, all ſweetnes, all quietnes, &amp; all peace. And ſo by this meane, there increaſeth daily, a certaine vnion, and ſtreighte bande of loue, betweene her and God; which in tyme, cometh to be ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully wrought, that ſhe is altogether, as it were, transfourmed into him. Wherupon it cometh to paſſe, that ſhe can loue, delite, thinke, and remember, none other thing, but only him. All other creatures ſhe loueth, knoweth, and conſiderereth in him: euen as a man doth, that diueth and ſwymmeth vnder the water, who ſeeth and feeleth nothing, that is not either water, or conteined in the water. And if he ſee anie thing, that is out of the water, he ſeeth it, not properly as it is in it ſelfe, but as the likenes of the ſame ſheweth in the water, and not otherwiſe. This is a verie perfecte and ſure rule, by the which a man maie make a iuſt eſtimate, both of him ſelfe, and of all creatures, grown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a moſt certaine, and infallible truth, which is almightie God. Vpon this ſhe brought in an other Doctrine alſo, which ſhe tooke ſuch pleaſure in, that ſhe ceaſed not to repeate it againe and againe, as a thing verie worthie to be noted. A ſowle, ſaid ſhe, that is thus plon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the loue of God, looke how much ſhe loueth God, ſo much ſhe hateth her ſelfe,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8350:46"/> that is, her owne ſenſualitie, which is the roote, and beginnyng of all ſynne, and from whence ſhe ſeeth to ariſe, the cauſe of her ſeparation from God, which is her whole felicitie, and final perfection. The which thing when a ſowle preceiueth, ſhe conceiueth a great miſliking, which bringeth foorth a certaine holie hatred, againſt her owne luſtes, and withal an earneſt deſire, to kill the roote of the ſame, which roote is ſelfe loue. But bicauſe ſhe ſeeth, that the roote is ſo deepe, that it can not be vtterly grub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed vp, but that there will remaine ſome peece of it, which will from tyme to tyme moleſt her: therefore doth ſhe likwiſe, increaſe daily in this holie hatred, whereof is engendred, a certaine frutful deſpiſing, and ſetting at naught of her ſelfe; which by the force and vertue of the loue of God, the ouercomer of all deiection and confuſion, riſeth vp with a greater hope &amp; deſire, and auanceth it ſelfe towardes God: for whoſe loue ſhe is deſirous to abide all paines, and roughnes of diſcipline, hoping thereby to ſubdue al inordinate appitites, and pronenes, to ſynne in her ſelfe, which are the lettes and ſtaies, that keepe her from her deſired ioye, and vnion with God. And in this humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her ſelfe, ſhe receiueth an inward light of grace, by the which ſhe cometh to ſee, and to acknowledge, the mercifull goodnes of God, who is euermore readie to pardon, and will not the death of a ſynner, but rather that he turne
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8350:46"/> and liue. Which conſideration, increaſeth her loue towardes him paſſingly: and by loue ſhe purchaſeth daily greater grace, ſtrenght, and fulnes of peace in her ſelfe, and ſo goeth fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in perfection of charitie, vntill at the le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght it pleaſeth God, to plucke her as a melowe apple, from this tree of bitternes, and to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her wholly into him ſelfe, who is the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting tree of ſweetnes and life. And thus is this holie hatred, the true keeper, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the ſowle, the fortereſſe and ſure caſtel, of a quiet and aſſured hope in God. This is that, which the holie Apoſtle meant, when he ſaid: <hi>VVhen I am weake, then am I ſtrong.</hi> For our Lord had declared vnto him, that ſtrenght is wrought in weakenes. And therefore he ſaieth alſo: <hi>I will gladly reioyce in myne infirmities, that the power of Chriſt may dwell in me.</hi> Now this infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was nothing els, but only that hatred of him ſelfe, that we here ſpeake of: Which was cauſed in him, by the knowledge of that roote of inordinate luſtes, and of his weakenes, and inſufficiencie to all good workes, which he ſawe was in him ſelfe The which thing when he perceiued, he waxed weake and feeble, that is, he deſpaired in him ſelfe, and acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging his owne feeblenes, yealded him ſelfe humbly, into the mightie handes of God, in whom only it laie, to cure his infirmitie. Who like a louing Father, foorthwith accepted that lowlie reſignation of him ſelfe, and laying his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8350:47"/> almightie hand vpon him, made him ſtrong in God, that was content to confeſſe, how weake and in ſufficient he was in him ſelfe. When this holie virgin ſpake theſe, and other wordes to like purpoſe, ſhe burſt out, as it were of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inward ioye and iubilee, that ſhe felt in her ſpirite, and ſaid; O wonderful goodnes of God, how ſtrangely doſt thou diſpoſe of of thinges! Out of vice, thou draweſt vertue, out of weakenes, ſtrength, out of offence, great grace, and fauour. O deere children, ſaid ſhe, haue this holie hatred in your ſelues; for out of it ariſeth true meekenes, and humilitie of hart: by reaſon whereof, you ſhall account all your workes, and other thinges as ſmoke and vanities, and ſhall glorie only in God. This holie hatred, ſhall make you to haue a great moderation, and ſtaie in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie, and withal a goodlie quietnes, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience in aduerſitie. It ſhall cawſe you to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and comelie in your conuerſation with men; gratious and acceptable, in all your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of pietie before God. Manie tymes alſo ſhe would adde furthermore, and ſaie contrariwiſe. Woe be to that ſowle, in the which this holie hatred lodgeth not: for it can not be choſen, but that in ſuch a ſowle there muſt needes reigne ſelfe loue, which is the roote, fowndation, and ſyncke of all inordinate luſtes. And therefore, when ſhe ſawe anie ſynne, or vice, in anie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8350:47"/> being moued with a certaine compaſſion, ſhe vſed often tymes to ſaie. This is the frute of ſelfe loue, the mother of pride, and of all other euels. Doe therefore (ſaid ſhe to her ghoſtlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and others) your vttermoſt endeuour, to grubbe it vp out of your hart, and to plant in the ſame that holie hatred; for that is the kinges high waie, verie certainly knowen, and well troden: in the which all our defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes, are perfectly corrected without anie errour, and by it we clyme vp to the mount of all vertues, in the higheſt perfection. Thus much ſawe the glorious Father S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> when he deſcribed two cities, the owne fownded vpon the loue of our ſelues, which tendeth to the diſhonour of God, and the other grownded vpon the loue of God, which tendeth to the abbaſing of our ſelues.</p>

                  <p> AFter that ſhe had learned theſe leſſons (which were manie moe, then are here ſpecified) it pleaſed the wiſedome of God, (who ſeeth, that his ſeruantes, doe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly take more good of their battailes againſt the enemie, then they doe in the tyme of peace) to ſuffer his humble handmaid, to enter a great combat with prowd Satan. And bicauſe his will was, that ſhe ſhould ouercome in that battaile, he would, that beſides the furniture, which he had geuen her before, ſhe ſhould now put on a ſpecial armour of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> to ſerue her againſt all the aſſaultes of the enemie. The which though he were willing, to geue her of his own more bowntifulnes, yet bicauſe he deliteth to be ſought vnto, and geueth his graces more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, when they are earneſtly ſought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly craued at is hand: therefore certaine daies, before this battaile ſhould begynne, he put in the hart of his ſpowſe, that ſhe ſhould humble her ſelfe before him in praier, and craue the vertue of <hi>Fortitude.</hi> The which praier our Lord anſwered effectually, and gaue her both the vertue that ſhe deſired, and withal a verie ſweet leſſon concernyng the ſame, ſaying. Daughter, if thou wilt haue the vertue of <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi> thou muſt endeuor to folowe me. True it is, that I was able of myne owne power, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the forces of the enemie, by diuerſe and ſundrie waies. But for your behooſe and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I choſe rather to vanquiſh him, by dying
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8350:48"/> vpon the Croſſe: that you, that be only men, might learne, if you mynded to encounter with the enemie, to take the Croſſe, as I did, and ſo by vertue of the ſame, to ouercome al his wyles and ſtrength. And be you well aſſured, that this Croſſe ſhalbe a refresſhing vnto you in your ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, if you haue mynd of the paines, that I ſuffred on it for your ſake. If you ſuffer for my loue with me, you ſhalbe rewarded with me. And the more like you be to me in this life, in perſecutions and paines, the more like ſhal you be to me in the life to come, in ioye and reſt. Embrace therefore, my deere daughter, embrace the Croſſe; receiue all bitter thinges and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, with a willing and cheereful hart. And dread no power, neither of man, nor of the deuel. For in whatſoeuer tyme or maner, they ſhall make anie enforcement againſt thee, by this meane thou ſhalt eaſily withſtand, &amp; put backe, all their violent attemptes. When this good diſciple of Chriſt, had heard this leſſon, ſhe forgat it not, but laied it vp with a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t regard in her memorie; And euermore afterwardes, ſhe had paſſing great ioye and delite, in bearing tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and aduerſitie. In ſo much that there was nothing in the earth, that ſhe tooke ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort in, as ſhe did in Croſſes, troubles, and hard diſcipline. For ſhe beleeued aſſuredly, that by troubles and vexations, ſhe approched neere vnto her ſpowſe, and was made like vnto him: the which the longer they were, and more
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8350:49"/> extreme, the greater weight of glorie ſhe knewe, that they wrought in her for the tyme to come. Now, when our Lord ſawe, that his ſpowſe was thus ſufficiently furniſhed &amp; armed, againſt all aſſaultes, it ſeemed a fit tyme, to open the waie to the enemie, and to permit him to come againſt her, with all his ſtrength &amp; malice. Satan ſawe, how much ſhe profited in ſpiritual life: how luſtely &amp; ſtowtely ſhe clymmed vp to the mount of all perfection. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that ſhe was of the weaker kind, to witt, a woman, and withal of yeares verie yong and tender: all the which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to greater griefe &amp; confuſion.

                     </gap>ame of vertue, which men had conceiued of her: by reaſon whereof, he ſawe, that in tyme he was in da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, to leeſe manie ſowles, whereupon when he was permitted by God, he began to aſſiege this ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fortreſſe, diuerſe and ſundrie waies. The firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaultes, were verie ſtrange tentations of the fleſh, in the which, ſommetymes he fourmed in her fantaſie (both waking and ſleeping) illuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and dreames, which were wanton and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt; and ſometimes he made certaine corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral viſions to appeere vnto her, forming bodies in the ayer, the which he cauſed to vtter manie wordes and geſtures, which were verie filthie and vnſeemelie to be ſpoken. When the bleſſed virgin, heard and ſawe thoſe thinges, ſhe ran foorthwith with great feare and horrour (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine that ſhe had learned) to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8350:49"/> her yron chaine, with the which, ſhe beat her bodie ſo much, that the blood ran out in ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes. And vnto that rough diſcipline, ſhe added further more ſo much watching, that in a maner ſhe yealded no reſt at all to her bodie. But the more ſhe increaſed her auſteritie of diſcipline, the more did the enemie, buſie him ſelfe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and multiplying his aſſaultes, cawſing ſuch viſions to appeere vnto her, both more manifeſtly, and alſo in greater nomber; and ſometymes they ſhewed them ſelues, to haue as it were, a certaine pitie, and compaſſion, on the great penance, that ſhe put her ſelfe vnto, and ſaid vnto her. Alas poore wretch, what meaneſt thou thus to torment thy bodie in vaine? Wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt thou, that thou ſhalt be able to endure this hard diſcipline to the end? What gayne ſhall it be to thee, if thou murther thy ſelfe? How much better were it for thee, to leaue off this folie, before thou be vtterly ſpent. Thou art yet a yong woman, and the tyme of pleaſure is not paſſed. Nature is not ſo decaied, but that thou maieſt well recouer, both thy ſtrength &amp; bewtie, and ſo ſhew emong other women, and take a husband, and leaue ſome increaſe to the worlde. Maieſt thou not as well pleaſe God, in the holie ſtate of matrimonie, as in this barren and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruteful ſtate, that thou haſt now taken? Haſt not thou heard tell of <hi>Sara, Rebecca, Lia, Rachel,</hi> with manie others, that liued verie perfectly, and honorably, in the ſtate of matrimonie?
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8350:50"/> Who hath brought thee, to enter into this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular trade of life, ſo hard and ſtreight, that thou ſhalt neuer be able to hold out in it? All the while, that the enemies, were ſpeaking theſe and other the like wordes vnto her, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in praier, and kept her hart pure from all vncleannes: and gaue them not one woord to anſwere, ſauing only, when they went about to bring her in deſpaire of continuance, in that holie order of life, then would ſhe ſaie. I truſt in my Lord Ieſu Chriſt, and not in my ſelfe. And they could neuer gett other word of her. And therefore afterward, when ſhe talked with her ghoſtlie Father, and others, that conuerſed with her, ſhe was wont to geue them this leſſon for a general rule, that when they had to deale with the enemie, tempting them to anie maner of ſynn, they ſhould neuer ſtand to reaſon, or diſpute with him: forſomuch as he truſteth verie much, in his malicious &amp; ſophiſtical ſuttelties, &amp; if he maie a litle incline the will of man, he wil ſoone induce his vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to errour. But the ſureſt waie in this caſe is, to deale as a true wife is wont to doe, when ſhe is moued by an adulterer to diſhoneſtie: vnto whom ſhe maketh none anſwere, whatſoeuer he ſaie, neither will ſhe ſo much as looke in his face, but foorthwith tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth awaie from him, and ſo keepeth her ſelfe faithfull and true, to her husband. And ſo did this chaſt virgin to her ſpowſe Chriſt: and by this meane ſhe gate a great victorie ouer her
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8350:50"/> enemie, boring his eares, with the naile of a ſtrong and faithful praier. Howbeit, though he ſawe his firſt aſſault thus eaſily fruſtrate and put by, yet did he not ceaſe, but moued an other battaile againſt her, which was much more fierce and cruel then the foremer.</p>

                  <p>WHen the vncleane ſpirites ſawe, that this attempt tooke no place; but was by the grace of God eaſily ouercome: they tooke diuerſe and ſundrie ſhapes of men and women, and ſetting them ſelues in ſuch fourmes, before the eyes of the chaſt virgin, they exerciſed moſt filthie actes of the fleſh, and ſpake verie fowle wordes, and vſed all poſſible meanes to ſterre vp her mynd and bodie to vncleannes. The which what a great griefe it cauſed to her vnſpotted, and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie hart, thoſe only are able to conſider, that knowe, what a goodlie treaſure, a pure and chaſt conuerſation is in the ſight of God, and ſo conſequently, what a great loſſe it is to be in danger to be ſpoiled of the ſame. It was alſo a great torment, and increaſe of heauines, to her
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8350:51"/> mynd, to conſider, that her deere ſpowſe and Lord, who was wont afore to viſite and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her oftentymes, ſeemed now, as though he had vtterly forſaken her, and would no more relieue and ſuccour her in her diſtreſſe, although for her part ſhe did what in her laie, knocking at the gate of his mercie with continual praier, teares, and hard diſcipline vpon her bodie. And when ſhe ſawe, that he made no anſwere, ſhe began to deuiſe a certaine newe maner of ſleight, to encounter with the enemie (how be it not without the ſecret inſtincte of God:) which was this. She conceiued a meruelous great miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of her ſelfe, and againſt her owne ſynnes, and ſo turnyng her indignation, as it were againſt her ſelfe, ſhe vttered ſuch wordes. Ah moſt vile wretch, lookeſt thou to receiue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort? Thinkeſt thou, that thy ſynnes haue deſerued it at Gods hand? O moſt vnkind caitife, is it not ynough for thee, that thou art pardoned of the paines of hell? O vnthankeful creature, doſt not thou take it to be gaine ynough, that the endles mercie of God, that changed thoſe euerlaſting tormentes, into theſe temporal afflictions? Were it not a verie gaineful exchange for thee, though they ſhould endure all the tyme of thy life? Wilt thou then be diſmaied, and relent thy wonted mortification, and diſcipline, knowing, that by theſes meanes, thou ſhalt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape endles paines, and within a ſhort tyme, receiue endles ioye and comfort at the hand of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8350:51"/> thy deere ſpowſe Ieſus Chriſt? By this maieſt thou trie, whether thou haue choſen to ſerue God for theſe temporal viſitations and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortes, or elſe in hope of that euerlaſting bleſſe, and ioyful fruition of him ſelfe, in the life to come. A wake therefore, take a good hart, fight manfully, and expecte with patience, the good will and pleaſure of God. Now is the tyme for thee, to increaſe to thy ſelfe, labour and paine, and to his holie name honour and glorie. It can not be expreſſed in wordes, how much ſhe was ſtrengthened in ſowle by this meane, and contrariwiſe how much the prowd enemie, was by the ſame confownded, and weakened. She confeſſed afterwardes to her ghoſtlie Father, that there was ſuch a rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of thoſe fowle feendes at that tyme in her chamber, mouing her diuerſe and ſundrie waies to vncleannes, that ſhe was enforced for a tyme, to flee from her chamber to the Church, and there to keepe more then ſhe was wont to doe. How be it euen in the Church alſo, ſhe was moleſted, thought not ſo much as before in her chamber. Whether when ſhe returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes, ſhe was againe ſo beſet with ſuch a compaine of vncleane ſpirites, repreſenting there before her ſo manie actes of filthines, and that with ſo great importunitie and ſtrange maners, that it was a verie miracle, how ſhe was able to ſuſteine the ſame. But ſhe forth with fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe to the earth, &amp; there lying groueling
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:8350:52"/> on her face in praier, beſought God of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, with ſuch mightie ſighes, and groanes, that in contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her pitiful crie, he ſomewhat aſſwaged the furie of thoſe fowle feendes. And ſo continuyng in ſuch afflictions, and troubles, a great number of daies, at the lenght, when at a tyme comyng from the Church, and lying after ſuch a maner in her chamber, ſhe made her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt praier vnto God, crauing his mercifull aide and aſſiſtance, there appeered a certaine comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beame of the holie Ghoſt, which brought vnto her remembrance the goodlie leſſon, that our Lord had thaught her before, when ſhe praied vnto him, for the gyfte of Fortitude. And ſo vnderſtanding that all, that was there done, was only the tentation of the enemie, ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great ioye in her hart, and determined from that daie foreward, to ſuffer meekely, &amp; gladly, all maner of tentations and afflictions, for the loue of her ſpowſe Ieſus Chriſt. Then one of thoſe wicked ſprites, (who was peraduenture of greater boldnes, and malice, then the reſt) ſpake vnto her after this maner. Wretched woman, what meaneſt thou? Thinkeſt thou euermore to lead ſuch a ſtate of life, as this is? Make thy ſelfe well aſſured of this: We ſhall neuer geue thee one hower of reſpite, but ſhall paine, and vexe thee continually, vntill thou yeald, and conſent, vnto our will. Vnto whom ſhe made anſwere out of hand, with a great courage and affiance in God, and ſaid; I haue
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8350:52"/> choſen paine for my refreſhing: and therefore it ſhall not be yrckeſome to me, but rather plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delitefull, to ſuffer theſe, and all other afflictions, for the loue of my Lord and Sauiour, ſo long and ſo much, as ſhall pleaſe his diuine maieſtie. With that woord, all that deteſtable companie of vncleane ſprites, vaniſhed quite awaie, with a verie dreadfull, &amp; horrible noyſe. And behold foorth with, there appeered a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous goodlie light from heauen, which ſhone all ouer her chamber, and in that light our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, in ſuch fourme, and maner, as he was, when he hong vpon the Croſſe, and there ſhed his moſt precious blood, for the redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the worlde. Who called her vnto him, and and ſaid theſe wordes. Myne owne daughter <hi>Catherine,</hi> ſeeſt thou not, what I haue ſuffred for thy ſake? Thinke it not much therefore, to ſuffer for me. After that, he approched neerer vnto her in an other fourme to comfort her, and ſpake vnto her, manie ſweet and louing wordes, and ſhe likewiſe to him. O Lord (ſaid ſhe, vſing the wordes of <hi>S. Antonie)</hi> where wert thou, when my hart was ſo vexed, with ſowle and lothſome tentations. Daughter, ſaid he, I was in thyne hart. Then ſaid ſhe againe. O Lord, ſauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thy truth, and my dutiful reuerence to thy diuine Maieſtie, how is it poſſible, that thou ſhouldeſt dwell in an hart, repleniſhed with ſo manie filthie, and ſhameful thoughtes?

But my preſence was it, that cauſed that miſliking in thyne hart, and moued thee, to make reſiſtance againſt thoſe fowle tentations: the which thy hart refuſed ſo much as it could; &amp; bicauſe it could not doe ſo much, as it would, it conceiued a greater diſpleaſure, both againſt them, and alſo againſt it ſelfe. It was my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious preſence, that wrought all theſe goodlie effectes in thyne hart: wherein I tooke great delite, to ſee my loue, my holie feare, and the zeale of my faith, planted in thy ſowle, my deere daughter and ſpowſe. And ſo, when I ſawe my tyme (which was, when thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt through my grace and aſſiſtance thoroughly vanquiſhed the pride and inſolencie of thyne enemie) I ſent out certaine external beames of my light, that put theſe darcke feendes to flight. For by courſe of nature, darckenes maye not abide, where light is laſt of all,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8350:53"/> by my light, I gaue thee to vnderſtand, that thoſe paines were thy great merite, gayne, and increaſe of the vertue of Fortitude. And bicauſe thou offredſt thy ſelfe willingly to ſuffer for my loue, taking ſuch paines with a cheerefull hart, and eſteemyng them as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, according to my doctrine: therefore my will and pleaſure was, that they ſhould endure no longer. And ſo I ſhewed my ſelfe: where vpon they vaniſhed quite awaie. My daughter, I delite not in the paines of my ſeruantes, but in their good will, and readines, to ſuffer patiently, and gladly for my ſake. And bicauſe ſuch patience, and willingnes, is ſhewed in paines and aduerſitie, therefore doe I ſuffer them, to endure the ſame. Take this ſimilitude of my bodie. At what tyme my bodie hong vpon the Croſſe in extreme paines and tourmentes, and afterwardes when it laie dead vpon the ground, no man could euer haue thought, that all that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, there had ben in it hiden that true life, that geueth life and mouing, to euerie liuing thing. And yet ſo it was by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the inſeperable vnion, that was, and is, betweene my Godhead and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: though not ſo vnderſtood of men, no, not of myne owne Apoſtles and diſciples, that had conuerſed with me a long tyme. Now, as at that tyme, when my bodie laie there dead, void of ſenſe, and without all
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:8350:54"/> outward ſhewe of anie inward power, there was not withſtanding in it, a diuine power able to quiken and geue life to other creatures, no leſſe then afterwardes, when it was raiſed from death, and endewed with the glorious gyftes of immortal life: euen ſo (though after a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent maner) do I dwell in the ſowles of my faithful ſeruantes, at one tyme couertly, and without ſhewing my ſelfe, for their exerciſe &amp; further merite, and at an other tyme openly and without couert, for their comfort and ioye. In this the tyme of thy battaile, I was in thyne hart, armyng and fortifying thee with my grace, againſt the force of the enemie, but couertly, for to exerciſe thy patience and increaſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite. But now, that thou haſt through my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, fought out thy battaile manfully, and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the enemie, I geue thee to vnderſtand, that I am and wilbe in thyne hart more openly, yea and withal, more often for thy comfort. And with theſe wordes, that bleſſed viſion ended: at what tyme the holie virgin was left, repleniſhed with ſuch abundance of ioye, and ſweetnes, that no penne is able to deſcribe it. And ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſhe tooke paſſing great comfort in that, that our Lord called her, <hi>Myne owne daughter Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine.</hi> And therefore ſhe entreated her ghoſtlie Father, that when he ſpake vnto her, he would vſe the ſelfe ſame wordes, and ſaie, <hi>My daughter Catherine:</hi> to the end that, by the often repetition of thoſe wordes, ſhe might often tymes renewe

But when ſhe had trauailed about the ſame, a certaine of weekes, and ſawe that ſhe did but leeſe her tyme: ſhe thought good to geue ouer that courſe, and to ſet her ſelfe againe, to her cuſtomable exerciſes, of praier and meditation.

While ſhe was thus praying, with great feruour of mynd, and inſtance, behold our Lord appeered vnto her, after a verie comfortable maner, and ſaid theſe wordes.

As our Lord was ſpeaking theſe wordes, there appeered in the ſame place, the moſt glorious virgin <hi>Marie</hi> mother of God, the beloued diſciple <hi>S.

And this trial liked him verie well, bicauſe being learned in the ſtudie of diuinitie, he knewe, that the deuel could not poſſibly be the authour of true Contrition to anie man, and that it is not in the power of anie creature, but only of God, to moue the hart of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to what him liſteth. And ſo with this intent he went vnto her, &amp; without declaring anie thing particularly, he deſired her, that ſhe would doe him a pleaſure. What

Whereunto ſhe made anſwere, with a cheereful countenance (as caſting no doubt at all of the effecte) that ſhe would doe it. Then ſaid he againe. Daughter, I thanke you for this. But yet thus much I muſt tell you more; That vnleſſe you procure me, ſome good aſſurance of the ſame, you doe me no pleaſure at all. What aſſurance would you require, ſaid ſhe? I would require, ſaid he, that I might haue a full Pardon, and a Bull drawen vpon the ſame, after the maner of the court of Rome. With that ſhe ſmiled ſweetly, and asked him, what maner of Bull he would haue. The Bull, ſaid he, that I deſire, is, that I maie feele in my ſelfe, a certaine deepe, and perfecte Contrition of my ſynnes, beyond the common courſe. At that word ſhe gaue him ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable looke, that it ſeemed to him, that ſhe had entred into all the ſecrets of his hart. Well, ſaid ſhe, ſuch a Bull ſhall you haue alſo. And ſo they parted: for the daie was almoſt ſpent.

And ſcantly could he anſwere her and ſaie, that he was ſorie, that ſhe ſhould take ſuch paines in comyng to him, being her ſelfe in farre weaker ſtate, then he was, but that ſhe was entred, without anie further circumſtances, into an high diſcourſe (as her maner was) of heauenlie matters, of God, and of his benefites beſtowed vpon his creatures; and contrariwiſe, of our vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes towardes him, and proneneſſe to offend ſuch a good, and bowntiful Lord.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter that our Sauiour Chriſt, had thus eſpowſed this holie virgin to him ſelfe, and beawtified her with manie graces, and gyftes: his will &amp; pleaſur was, that ſhe ſhould from that tyme foreward, by litle, and litle, ſhewe her ſelfe to the worlde; that the graine, that had now lyen hidden in the grownd a conuenient tyme, and was ſufficiently mortified, might bud, flower, and bring foorth the frute of manie excellent vertues, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of men. Wherefore on a tyme, when he had ſhewed her many myſteries of the kingdome of heauen, and had taught her alſo to ſaie the Pſalmes, and Canonical howers with him ſelfe (as is declared before) he bad her, that ſhe ſhould goe downe to eate with others, and then returne to him againe. When ſhe heard that, ſhe ſobbed and wept, &amp; fell downe at his feete after a verie
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:8350:61"/> pitiful maner, and ſaid vnto him. O moſt ſweet Ieſu, whie wilt thou put me awaie from thee? If I haue offended thy diuine Maieſtie, behold here my bodie at thy feete, laie what penance it ſhall pleaſe thee vpon it, and I will helpe with all my hart. Only this I beſeech thee, let me not be ſo ſharply puniſhed, as to be ſundred from thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed preſence. What haue I to doe with their meates? I haue meate to eate, that they knowe not of. Oh my good Lord, wherefore doſt thou will me, to goe to eate with them? Doth man liue of bread only, and not rather, and better, of euerie word, that cometh out of thy mouth? Art not thou he, my deere Lord, that haſt cawſed me to eſchewe the conuerſation of men? that I might the better conuerſe with thee? And now that I haue fownd thee, without anie deſert on my part, only of thy mere liberalitie and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſhall I be ſo vnhappie, as to forſake ſuch a goodlie treaſure, for to returne to the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of men, and ſo to dymme the puritie and cleerenes of my faith? Suffer not that, O my deere ſpowſe and Lord, for thyne infinitie goodnes. When ſhe had thus powred out her hart before our Lord, pitifully ſobbing and weeping, and lying proſtrate at his feete, he, like a merciful Lord, gaue her verie ſweet wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des againe, and ſaid. My deere daughter, leaue the care of thy ſelfe to me. It is meete, that thou doe fulfill all righteouſnes. Which thou canſt not doe, vnleſſe thou be fruteful and profitable, not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:8350:61"/> only to thy ſelfe, but alſo to others. Thinke not, my good daughter, that it is my meanyng to ſeparate thee from me, but rather to vnite thy hart more firmely vnto me. Knoweſt thou not, that all the lawe and prophetes ſtand of two pointes, to witt, of the loue of God, and of the loue of thy neighbour? Wherefore to make thee perfecte, my will is, that thou exerciſe thy ſelfe in the loue of thy neighbour, with great compaſſion and mercie, that thou maieſt flie vp to heauen, not with one wing, but with two. Call to mynd the zeale that thou haddeſt of winning ſowles, which, I planted in thy hart, euen in thyne infancie: at what tyme thou haddeſt a deſire to change thyne habite, and to clad thy ſelfe like a man, that thou mighteſt be receiued into the order of the Fryars Preachers. Remember, that this habite, which thou weareſt, is the habite of thy father <hi>S. Dominicke,</hi> and was geuen vnto thee by my deere mother, namely for a ſpecial loue and affection, that thou bareſt vnto him, for the great trauaile, that he ſuſteined in wynning of ſowles. Behold, I doe now diſpoſe, and ordaine thee, to that end, that thou diddeſt through my ſecret inſpiration ſo much deſire in thy yowth. I diſpoſe thee to that function, that my Father diſpoſed me vnto in the earth; I ordaine thee to that miniſterie, that I ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my beloued Apoſtles and diſciples vnto before I departed from them on the earth.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8350:62"/> And all this I doe for thy further merite and greater crowne. At theſe wordes the humble virgin tooke great comfort, and bowing downe her head with all ſubmiſſion, ſaid. O Lord thy will be done in all thinges, and not myne, for thou art light, and I am darckenes, thou art he that is: and I am ſhe, that is not; But yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, my Lord God, let me be ſo bold, as to aske, how I a wretched &amp; vile woman, ſhould be able to doe anie good in thy Church. How ſhall I being a ſimple woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be able to inſtructe wiſe and learned men? How ſhall it be ſeemelie for me, to liue and conuerſe emong men? Vnto that our Sauiour anſwered and ſaid. Who is he, that created man, &amp; made a diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene man &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? was it not I? If I the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of man &amp; woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what lawe maie reſtraine me, that I ſhall not doe with my creatures, what I ſhall thinke good? Can my power be limited, that I ſhall not diſpoſe of man and woman, of learned and vnlearned, of noble and baſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my will? Touching thy queſtion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, which is, how a woman, that is the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker veſſel, ſhould be an able and ſufficient meane to edifie men, with doctrine and example: bicauſe I knowe, that this thy demaund pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, not of anie lacke of faith in my almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie power, but only of an humble conſideration, of thyne owne weakenes and frailtie: I will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto thee my ſecret in this behalfe. Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is ſo, that now a daies there aboundeth ſuch pride in the worlde (and ſpecially in thoſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:8350:62"/> that hold them ſelues for learned and wiſe) that my iuſtice can no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger beare it; But bicauſe my mercie is aboue all my workes: as I haue deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to doe iuſtice vpon this heinous ſynne, ſo haue I alſo prouided a ſoueraigne medicine againſt the ſame, to as manie as will accept it. The proper medicine and puniſhment of pride, is to be confownded and brought to ſhame. And therefore my deliberation is, that theſe men, that are wiſe in their owne conceite, ſhalbe made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and controlled in their owne iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, when they ſhall ſee thoſe creatures, that they account vile and abiecte (as fraile and weake women) to vnderſtand the hidden myſteries of God, not by humane ſtudie, but only by grace infuſed, and to ſhewe the ſame to the worlde, both by word and example of life, and for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of ſuch doctrine, to worke manie ſtrange ſignes, wonders, and miracles aboue the courſe of nature. I will doe now, as I did, when I was conuerſant in the worlde: at what tyme I ſent ſimple men, idiots, and fisſhers (but reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with heauenlie knowledge, and ſtrength of my ſpirite) to controll the wiſedome of the worlde: ſo will I ſend thee at this tyme, and other ignorant perſones, both men and women to confownd the pride of thoſe, that are wiſe in their owne eyes. The which confuſion if they receiue, and humble them ſelues before me, confeſſing that all wiſedome &amp; power is myne: if they will reuerently embrace my doctrine,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8350:63"/> ſpread, throughout the worlde by ſuch weake &amp; fraile veſſels, I will haue mercie vpon them, and geue them a further increaſe of grace: and their confuſion, ſhalbe to them a medicine vnto euerlaſting ſaluation. But if they refuſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this medicine, and will needes folowe on in their old courſe, deſpiſing my holie word, &amp; perſecuting my belowed ſeruantes, and frindes: I ſhall bring them to ſuch confuſion, that the whole worlde ſhall deſpiſe them, and ſet them al at naught. And if after ſuch temporal confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in this worlde they ſhewe them ſelues ſtiffe necked, and vnrecouerable: I will adiuge them moreouer to euerlaſting confuſion in the world to come: Where, with great bitternes of hart, and penance without frute, they ſhall ſee them ſelues ſo much depreſſed, and holden downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneth them ſelues, as they had a deſire in this life, to be magnified and exalted aboue them ſelues. Wherefore, daughter, ſet thy ſelfe in a readines, to be ſent out into the worlde: for I wilbe with thee at all tymes, and in all places; I will viſite thee, and directe thee in all thinges, that I ſhall ſend thee to doe. When ſhe heard that, ſhe bowed downe her head with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence, and went downe (as our Lord had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her) to eate with the reſt of the howſehold: with whom ſhe continued for that tyme bodily, but her hart was fixed in God. And whatſoeuer ſhe ſawe or heard, of wordlie affaires, was te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and yrckeſome vnto her: and therefore
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:8350:63"/> ſo ſoone as ſhe might conueniently, ſhe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewe her ſelfe out of all companie, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againe to her Cell, that ſhe might there with the greater quetnes, enioye the deſired preſence of him, in whom ſhe had repoſed her whole loue and felicitie. From that tyme foreward, there grewe in her, a paſſing great deſire of receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament, of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: whereby ſhe beleeued faithfully, that ſhe ſhould receiue a further increaſe of grace, and be vnited to God: not only with the vnion of ſpirite, but alſo (after a ſort) with a bleſſed coniunction of bodies, while ſhe receiued his moſt bleſſed bodie into her bodie.</p>

For ſhewe of a great

And it pleaſed God alſo, that the ſeruant of the howſe ſhould be often ſicke: by reaſon whereof, her charge &amp; trauaile was doubled; For it laie vpon her, both to ſerue the whole howſehold, &amp; withal to haue a verie ſpecial and diligent regard, to the ſeruant that was ſicke.

While ſhe was occupied about the ſeruices of the howſe, it happened verie often, that ſhe was in a trawnce: at what tyme her bodie was lifted vp into the ayer, and hong there without anie thing to ſtaie it vp, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as a peece of yron, is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to hang at the adamant ſtone.

In the tyme, while ſhe was in ſuch trawnces, (which happened verie often vnto her) it was euidently ſeene, by as manie as chaunced then to be preſent, that her ſowle did withdrawe it ſelfe from the bodilie ſenſes, and that it did ſo forſake the bodie, that her handes &amp; feete were drawen together: in ſo much that if they happened to latch at anie thing, they held it ſo faſt, that yee might ſooner breake them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſunder them from the thing, of the which they tooke hold.

But, as God would haue it, one of the ſiſters, that was then preſent, &amp; vnderſtood the danger of the ſame, cried out vnto her, and bad her in anie caſe, that ſhe ſhould not doe it. And anon after, when ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, ſhe felt her necke ſo ſore, as if it had ben beaten with a ſtaffe.

Anon after, feeling her ſelfe meruelouſly well comforted, ſhe roſe vp early in the mornyng, and filled her ſacke with corne; ſhe tooke two great flaſcats alſo, one of wyne, and an other of oyle: and withal, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſhe fownd in the howſe meete to be eaten. And when ſhe had laid this prouiſion together, thinking it impoſſible to carrie it all at once to the widoes howſe, which was farre from thence (&amp; the thinges weighed no leſſe then an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred powndes) ſhe caſt vp her hart to her ſpowſe, and beſought him of his gracious aſsiſtance. That done, ſhe began to trie with a ſtowte hart, what ſhe was able to doe. Some part ſhe laid vpon her ſhoulders, ſome ſhe truſſed vnder her gyrdle,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:8350:68"/> ſome ſhe carried in her right hand, and ſome in her lefte. And when ſhe had loded her ſelfe with all this burthen, ſhe felt no more of it, then if it had ben a wad or wiſpe of ſtrawe: but ſo ſoone as the common bell of the citie had rong (before the which tyme it was not lawful for anie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone to walke in the ſtreetes) ſhe tooke her waie towardes the poore widowes howſe, and went ſo light on the grownd (not withſtanding all that heauie waight of prouiſion, and great feeblenes of bodie withall) as if ſhe had caried nothing, but had ben caried her ſelfe, as in truth ſhe was. But, when ſhe was almoſt come to the howſe, the burthen, that ſeemed before verie light, became ſo heauie and paineful to her, that ſhe thought, ſhe could not beare it one foote further. The which ſtrange alteration when ſhe felt in her ſelfe, ſhe conceiued foorthwith, that it was the will of God, that it ſhould ſo be. And therefore ſhe turned her ſelfe to him with a great affiance in his mercie, and made her humble petition to him, that he would vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſafe to eaſe her againe, and make her able to goe thorough with her burthen. And with that, finding her ſelfe to haue receiued ſufficient ſtrength to beare it out, ſhe held on her waie, till ſhe came to the widowes doore, which by the prouiſion of God ſhe found halfe open. And ſo putting it from her ſoftely with her hand, ſhe laid in her prouiſion with as litle noyſe, as was poſſible. Howbeit it was not done ſo priuily,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8350:68"/> but that the widowe awaked withal. The which ſhe perceiuing, made awaie as faſt as ſhe could. But there came vpon her (euen at that inſtant) ſuch a feeblenes, and withal ſuch a heauiſomenes of bodie, that ſhe was not able to crawle awaie, though her life had lyen on it. Wherefore tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng her ſelfe to our Lord, with a heauie hart (bicauſe ſhe feared, leſt her being there alone at that tyme of the daie, might be ſcandalous to weake myndes) and yet on the other ſide with a cheereful and ſmyling countenance (bicauſe ſhe ſawe, it was the will and pleaſure of her ſpowſe ſo to dalie with her) betweene game and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt (as it were) ſhe ſpake vnto him after this maner. O my deere Lord, whie haſt thou thus deceiued me? Shall it doe well, (thinkeſt thou) that all the worlde laugh me to ſcorne? Is it thy pleaſure, that all the neighbours here ſee, my folie, and hold me for a verie foole and ſott? See, o Lord, the daie cometh on faſt, which will diſcouer me to the worlde, and ſo ſhall I be taken for a fantaſtical woman, or peraduenture for worſe. O my good Lord, and ſweet loue of my hart, haſt thou now forgoten thyne old mercies, ſhewed from tyme to tyme to me thyne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie handmaid? Geue me, I beſeech thee, ſo much ſtrength, that I maie be able to returne home to my chamber: and then laie vpon me ſo much weakenes, as pleaſeth thee. With that ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced her ſelfe the beſt ſhe could, to creepe with hand and foote vpon the grownd: and while
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8350:69"/> ſhe was ſo creeping, ſhe ſpake to her bodie after this maner: liue thou, die thou, awaie thou muſt. Whether thou be able or not able, here is no being. And therefore on a Gods name. And ſo, what with going, and what with crawling, ſhe wonne a litle grownd. But before ſhe could, get out of ſight, the poore widowe came downe, &amp; ſeeing her in the ſtreet, and no moe but her, knewe by her habite, whoe it was, that had done her that charitable pleaſure. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord heard the groanyng of his deere ſpowſe, and pitying her poore caſe, gaue her ſo much ſtrength, that ſhe gate home, before it was brode daie. Where ſhe receiued great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort of mynd in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods mercie and louing kindnes towardes her: and withall her ould diſeaſes &amp; feeblenes of bodie, for her further increaſe of grace &amp; merite.</p>

The poore man made anſwere, that he could not

Tarrie here a litle while, ſaid ſhe, till I goe to yonder chapel and come againe: and then, God willing, I will helpe thee of clothes. With that ſhe went vp againe to the chapel, and did of her kyrtel: vnder the which ſhe ware a ſliueles peticote, which ſhe put off, and came downe againe, and gaue it to the poore man with a glad cheere. When the poore man had receiued that cote, he beſought her furthermore, that ſeeing ſhe had ſerued his turne of a wollen garment to

With a verie good will, ſaid ſhe, come home with me, &amp; I will ſeeke one out for thee. And ſo ſhe went on afore, and the poore man came after. When ſhe was come home, ſhe went to the cheſtes and preſſes; where the lynen clothes of her Father and brothers were laid vp, and tooke out a ſhirt and certaine other lynnen clothes, and gaue the ſame gladly to the poore man. When the poore pilgryme had receiued all thoſe thinges at her hand, he went not his waie, but praied her yet more, that ſhe would geue him ſlewes to his peticote to couer his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes withal. With a good will, ſaid ſhe: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I graunt, this cote were to no great pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.

Who receiued thoſe ſleeues alſo than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kefully at her hand, as he had done all the reſt, and ſaid vnto her. Maiſtres, ye haue now clothed me thoroughly: he, for whoſe loue ye haue done it, thanke you for it. But yet one demaund more I haue to make vnto you. I haue a companion lying in an hoſpital hereby, who ſtandeth in great need of clothes. If it ſhall pleaſe you to ſend him anie, I will carrie them vnto him in your

On the one ſide ſhe was much moued with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion of that poore man, and had a paſſing great deſire to ſupplie his neceſſitie. On the other ſide ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the murmuring &amp; grudging of as manie as were in the howſe: who waxed ſo weerie of her liberal dealing out of thinges, that, to keepe them from her handes, they began euerie one to keep their apparel &amp; other goods, vnder locke &amp; keye. Againe, ſhe thought, ſhe had done ynough to take awaie the ſleeues of the ſeruantes newe cote, that was neuer worne, &amp; that ſhe could not with diſcretion take anie more from her, being her ſelfe alſo needie &amp; poore. Then began ſhe to reaſon with her owne ſelfe, &amp; to diſcuſſe in her mynd, whether ſhe might conueniently depart with her owne garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or no. She was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to doe it, bicauſe ſhe knewe, that it was a great worke of charitie, and ſawe alſo in reaſon, that ſhe was better able to bear that lacke of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, then the pore man was.

All the which thinges thus conſidered and diſcreetly weighed, ſhe reſolued in her ſelfe, that in this caſe it was farre better for her, and withall more pleaſing

And vpon this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe ſpake to the poore man, after a verie gentle and ſweet maner, and ſaid. Truly, good man, if I might doe it with honeſtie, I would ſpoile my ſelfe euen of this cote, that I weare, with all my hart, &amp; beſtowe it vpon thy compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But bicauſe I haue no moe garmentes to put on, but only this, and therefore to geue it awaie to an other, and to lacke my ſelfe, were not only an vndiſcrete part, but alſo againſt all honeſtie &amp; woman-hood: I muſtes needes praie thee to hold me excuſed, for in truth there lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no good will in me, but only abilitie. With that the poore man ſmyled vpon her, and ſaid. Maiſtres, I ſee right well, that if yee had ought to geue, you would gladly geue it. I thanke you for your good will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God reward you and keepe you. And ſo he tooke his leaue of her, and went his waie in ſuch ſort, that ſhe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by certaine ſignes, that this poore pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gryme ſhould be he, that was wont to apeere vnto her. But ſuch was her lowlines &amp; baſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of her ſelfe, that ſhe thought her ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie to receiue anie ſuch co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort and honour at Gods hand: &amp; therefore with an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble mynd, ſhe returned to her wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſeruices in the howſe, where not withſtanding ſhe kept her hart euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more fixed vpon her deere ſpowſe Ieſus Chriſt. who the next night folowing appeered vnto her
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8350:72"/> againe, as ſhe was praying, in the likenes of that poore man, holding in his hand that cote, that ſhe had geuen him, all decked and ſet with goodlie perles and precious ſtones, that ſhone all ouer the chamber, and ſaid vnto her. Deere daughter, knoweſt thou this cote? yea Lord, ſaid ſhe, I knowe it verie well: but it was not ſo richly decked, when it was with me. Then ſaid our Lord to her againe. Yeſter daie thou gaueſt me this coate verie freely &amp; charitably, to couer the nakednes of my bodie, and to keepe it from cold and ſhame. This daie, for recompence of thy great charitie towardes me, I geue thee a cote, that ſhalbe inuiſible to other men, but to thee alone both viſible and alſo ſenſible, by the vertue whereof thou ſhalt be defended both in bodie and ſowle from all hurtful cold: and with this garment ſhalt thou be clad, vntill the tyme come, that in the preſence of all Angels and Sainctes I ſhall put on vpon thee, that moſt blisful and glorious garment of immortalitie in my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. When he had ſaid theſe wordes, foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he tooke out a cloth of a ſanguine colour, with his owne holie handes, out of the wound of his ſide, ſhynyng all about and yealding a meruelous beawtiful light, in proportion and qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>titie anſwerable to the meaſure of her bodie: and putting the ſame vpon her with his owne handes, ſaid.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8350:72"/> that thou ſhalt receiue at my handes in heauen. And with theſe wordes that viſion ceaſed, and left her endewed with ſuch a ſtrange grace and qualitie, not only in ſowle, but alſo in bodie, that from that verie inſtant, that our Lord ſpake vnto her, ſhe neuer felt alteration in her bodie, but continued euermore in one temper, whether it were winter or ſomer, hote or cold, wind or raine. And whatſoeuer wether came, ſhe neuer ware moe or fewer clothes, then one only ſingle peticote vnderneth, and one only ſingle kirtel aboue, and that rather for decencie, then for neceſſitie.</p>

The which thing when this holie maid vnderſtood being moued withal compaſſion ſhe tooke a lynnen bag, the ſhe had, and filled the ſame with egges, and caried it priuily vnderneth her cote towardes the howſe of the ſaid poore man, to relieue him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. When ſhe came neere the place, were he dwelt ſeeing a Church there by, ſhe entred into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:8350:73"/> it firſt (as her maner was) to doe her deuotion. Where lifting vp her hart to God in praier and comtemplation, ſhe was foorthwith ſo rauiſhed in ſpirite, that her bodilie ſenſes failing, ſhe fell downe with all the waight of her bodie on that ſide, where the bag of egges was. There was alſo in the bag a thymble, (ſuch as tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours do ſo we withal) which ſhe had forgoten to take out, when ſhe put in the egges. This thymble was broken in three peeces, and the egges remained as whole and as ſownd as they were put in, notwithſtanding that ſhe had lyen vpon them with the burthen of her whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and that for the ſpace of certaine howers. It pleaſed almightie God to work an other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſtrange miracle alſo to the like effecte: a thing well knowen and teſtified by as manie as were in the howſe; which were to the nomber of twentie perſones. It happened, that the howſehold had dronke out a veſſel of wine ſo lowe, that the remnant, that was left, ſeemed not good ynough to geue to the poore (for her maner was, alwaies to geue out the beſt in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes for Gods ſake.) Where vpon ſhe went to the next veſſel, and drewe out of that largely for the poore, a nomber of daies together, and was neuer eſpied by anie of the howſehold.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8350:73"/> they were wont to doe) ſufficiently: and ſhe gaue out (as her maner was) plentifully. And yet the wine neuer decreaſed, nether in quantitie nor qualitie, but kept euermore at one ſtaie, both for fulnes and for freſhnes. All the howſe had great wonder, how the veſſel ſhould continue ſo long, and withal ſo good. For they all knewe, that ſuch a veſſel was wont to ſerue the howſe, but only <hi>xv.</hi> or at the vttermoſt <hi>xx.</hi> daies. And this had continued a ful moneth, and yet to all their ſeemyng, was neither the leſſe in meaſure, nor worſe in taſt: but rather they all confeſſed, that in their whole life tyme, they had neuer taſted a better wine. But that holie maid made no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it: for ſhe vnderſtood, that it was the worke of God, whoſe propertie it is, to bleſſe &amp; multiplie the ſubſtance of thoſe, that are readie to geue to the poore for his loue. One moneth was fully expired, &amp; an other was well entred: &amp; yet the wine continued ſtill as good and as freſh, as it was the firſt daie that it was broached. At the length, when the tyme was come, that the grapes were ripe and readie to the preſſe to make newe wyne, he that had the chiefe charge about the making of the ſame, tooke order, that this veſſel, which had continued ſo long with old wine, ſhould be emptied, that it might be filled with newe wine. Whereupon one of the ſeruantes, which thought of all likelyhood, that there had ben litle or nothing left in the veſſel, went about to drawe it out into bottels. After the which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8350:74"/> maner when he had drawen a good deale, he ſawe ſtill, that it ran with full tap. At the laſt they reſolued to gawge the veſſel, and ſo to ſee, what was in it. The which they did: and behold, they fownd the veſſel ſo drie, as if it had ſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out licour, for the ſpace of manie monethes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Whereat the whole houſehold was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſly aſtoined: in ſo much that they had no greater wonder before to ſee the cleere colour, freſhnes, and long continuance of the wine, then they had now, to ſee ſo ſodaine an alteration and fayling of the ſame.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8350:74"/> receiued: but the hoſpital was ſo poore, that they were not able to make her allowance of ſuch thinges and ſeruices, as her diſeaſe required: and ſo, her maladie increaſing daily more and more, at the length ſhe became disfigured with a verie fowle leprie all ouer her bodie. Which made her ſo lothſome, to all that were in the hoſpital, that they eſchewed her, and there was none fownd, that would ſerue her anie longer. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they determined to ſend her to a ſpittle-houſe, that was ordained for ſuch Lazarous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, about a mile from the citie. But before ſhe was remoued, it pleaſed God, that this holie maid ſhould haue vnderſtanding of their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: Who, being inwardly moued with pitie, went foorthwith to the hoſpital, where ſhe laie, and ſerued her both with her bodie and with her goods, mornyng and euenyng proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for her, whatſoeuer ſhe thought neceſſarie or requiſite for a woman in that caſe, and dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame for her with her owne handes. And all this ſhe did with as diligent a care and great reuerence, as if ſhe had ben her owne mother. Which charitable and humble ſeruice, the ſicke woman tooke in verie good part at the firſt, and thought her ſelfe much beholding vnto her for it. But afterwardes, when ſhe ſawe, that the holie maid continued her diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance with ſuch regard and loue, as no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant would haue done the like: like a prowd and vnthankeful woman, ſhe tooke all that ſhe did,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8350:75"/> to be more then duetiful, and looked for it. In ſo much that, if anie thing were done otherwiſe, then her pleaſure was to haue it done, ſhe would chide with her, and reuile her, and ſpeake ſuch wordes of villanie and reproch vnto her, as no honeſt woman would haue ſpoken the like to her bondwoman or ſlaue, that ſhe had bought with her money. If it happened (as it did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes) that ſhe taried at Church about her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions, longer then her accuſtomed maner was: the waiward ſicke woman would receiue her at her returne, with verie ſharp and deſpiteful termes, ſaying. Ah ladie queene, yee are welcome. Where hath ladie queene ben ſo long? It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that the queene can neuer haue her fill of theſe Fryars. Theſe and other the like wordes would the old woman powre out againſt her with great ſtomacke and choler. But the holie maid gaue her not one euel word to anſwere, but went about her buſines diligently: and, when ſhe ſawe her tyme, ſhe would ſpeake to her after a gentle and lowlie maner, ſaying. Good mother, for Gods loue, haue patience; And if anie thing be amiſſe, it ſhalbe amended by and by. And with that ſhe beſtirred her ſelfe about that ſhe had to doe for her, with all poſſible diligence, and made a fyer, and dreſſed her meate, and ſerued her of all neceſſaries, after ſuch humble ſort, and with ſuch ſweete wordes, that the impatient woman, that was ſo caried awaie with her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8350:75"/> that ſhe ſeemed rather a raging bedlame, then a reſonable creature, had great wonder of her patience. This brawling continued a long tyme, and the more the diſeaſe increaſed vpon the old woman, the more wayward and tedious ſhe waxed: and yet was this holie maid neuer weerie of her lothſome ſeruice, but held out ſtill, and did all, that was to be done about her, with great loue and reuerence. At the length her mother <hi>Lapa,</hi> who had a great miſliking of that kind of ſeruice, cried out vpon her, and ſaid. Daughter, it can not be, but that, if thou continue in this maner of ſeruice, thou muſt needes in tyme become a leaper: which (thou knoweſt) I maie not abide to ſee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I charge thee in anie caſe to geue it ouer. Whereunto ſhe made anſwere verie diſcreetely, and ſaid. Good mother, haue you no feare or doubt of that, for the ſeruice that I do about this ſicke woman, is done by the commaundement of God. And thinke yee not, that he will laie ſo fowle a plague vpon me for that, that him ſelfe hath willed me to doe. And ſo with ſuch wordes ſhe quieted the mynd of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But our Lord, whoſe pleaſure it is to trie his faithful ſeruantes to the vttermoſt, permitted, in deed the enemie of mankind to haue ſuch power ouer her bodie, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected her handes with the leprie: in ſuch ſort, that euerie one, that looked vpon her, iudged by and by, that it came to her by the towching
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8350:76"/> of the contagious bodie of that ould woman. Which thing cauſed manie of them, that ſpake euel of her before, to ſpeake worſe now. Some ſaid this, and ſome ſaid that: euerie man might ſpeake his fantaſie freely: for it ſeemed, that they were not altogether without ſome good grownd. And (which was moſt of all) euerie bodie ſhuned her companie, as a woman infected with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſe. All which diſgrace moued her nothing at all, but that ſhe continued her won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted charitie and ſeruice towardes the ſicke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and tooke no care, what became of her owne bodie, ſo long as ſhe might emploie it to the ſeruice of God. That womans ſickenes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued manie daies: but the holie maid thought them verie fewe, by reaſon of the great loue, that ſhe had to our Lord, whom (ſhe thought) ſhe ſerued in that ſicke woman. At the length, when our Lord had thus ſufficiently tried, the loue and conſtancie of his faithful ſpowſe, he determined that this her paineful and lothſome ſeruice ſhould haue an end, by the paſſing of that ſicke woman out of this wretched life. At the which paſſage the holie maid ſtood by her, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her with her ſeruice, with good praiers, with godlie wordes and exhortations, and neuer gaue her ouer vntill the laſt breath. And when the bodie was dead, ſhe tooke off the clothes, and wasſhed it and ſhrowded it in the winding ſheet, and ſo laid it on the beere, readie to be caried to the place of burial. Where, when the Dirige
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8350:76"/> and other diuine ſeruice was done, according to the order of the Church, ſhe tooke it off againe, and laid it in the graue, and couered it with earth with her owne handes. That done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, by euident miracle and worke of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, her handes, which were before fowly disfigured with the leprie, were now at that verie inſtant become, not only ſownd &amp; whole, but alſo much fairer and cleerer, then anie other part of her bodie, to the ſight of as manie as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held her.</p>

                  <p>THe charitie of this holie maid, ſhewed vpon that vnthankeful leperous wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was ſurely verie great: and ſo was her charitie and patience, ſhewed towardes a ſiſter of her owne Order, no leſſe great and worthie to be remembred. There was emong the ſiſters of <hi>S.

In ſo much that, whenſoeuer mention was made of her, ſhe could not hold her ſelfe, but that ſhe muſt needes breake out into reprochful wordes, into backbiting &amp; ſlawndering, yea &amp; ſometymes to plaine curſſing and banning. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this holie maid vnderſtood that, ſhe bare her ſelfe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe verie lowlie and louingly towardes her, and did (what in her laie) to wynne her loue with gentle behauiour &amp; ſweet wordes.

This praier was made with ſuch feruour &amp; veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of ſpirite, that it perced the heauens and ſownded into the eares of almighty God: who, to cure that froward woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> finally of her ſynful diſeaſe of mynd, ſmote her mercifully with a certaine grieuous infirmity of bodie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy maid heard tell, that <hi>Palmerina</hi> was ſo da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly ſicke, ſhe was a heauie woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for her. For ſhe ſawe, that, if ſhe ſhould depart the worlde in that ſtate, her ſoule was loſt euerlaſtingly. Which
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8350:77"/> conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrought ſo in her, that ſhe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to leaue nothing vndone, that might poſſibly be done, for the recouerie of that ſowle. And ſo ſhe went to her, and with verie ſweet and louelie wordes, offred both her ſelfe &amp; all that ſhe had, to be at her deuotion and ſeruice. But the churliſh woman was ſo maliciouſly bent againſt her, that ſhe not only refuſed al this courteſie, but alſo reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her, vſing moſt vnſeemelie and reprochful la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage againſt her, and in the end bad her goe out of her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, with great threates &amp; thundering wordes. All which vilanie the holy maid bare with great meekenes &amp; patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: and continuyng her wonted charitie and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſion towardes that furious woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, turned her ſelfe to God againe in praier. In this meane tyme that wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſickenes, by the diuine prouidence and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of God, increaſed ſo vehemently vpon her, that, (without making anie reconciliation with God or the wordle) ſhe drewe on verie faſt to death, both of bodie &amp; ſoule. The which thing when the holie maid vnderſtood, her hart being thoroughly perced with the dartes of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe ſhut her ſelfe vp in her Cell, and there caſting her ſelfe downe proſtrate vpon the grownd, with much ſobbing, weeping, and lamentation, ſhe made her praier vnto God after this maner. O Lord my God &amp; Maker, maie it be, that I wretched creature ſhold be borne into the worlde to this end, that ſowles, which thou haſt created to thine owne ymage &amp; likenes, ſhould by anie
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:8350:78"/> occaſion of me be condemned to euerlaſting paines? Canſt thou (my good Lord and deere ſpowſe) ſuffer, that I, which ought to be to my ſiſter an inſtrument of euerlaſting ſaluation, ſhould now become an occaſion of her euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting woe and calamitie? Turne awaie that dreadful iudgement, O Lord, I beſeech thee for thy mercies ſake. It had ben better for me, that I had neuer ben borne, then that the ſowles, which thou haſt redeemed with the price of thy moſt precious blood, ſhould through me be brought againe into that miſerable captiuitie of our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient enemie the Deuel. O Lord, are theſe the promiſes, which thou madeſt vnto me, when thou diddeſt ſaie, that I ſhould be an inſtrument and meane, to wynne manie ſowles to thee? Are theſe the fruites of life, which I thyne vnworthie hand-maid ſhould bring foorth to the behoofe of others? There is no doubt, O Lord, but that my ſynne is the cawſe of all this, out of the which I can not looke to receiue anie better fruite, then this is. But yet, O Lord, I am right well aſſured, that the botomles ſea of thy mercies, can not be drayned or in anie part diminiſhed: and therefore I ſet my ſelfe here before thee with a great affiance, and humbly beſeech thee, that thou wilt vowch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to caſt downe the eyes of thy clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie vpon this wretched creature, thy ſeruant, my ſiſter This I moſt inſtantly craue of thee, o moſt ſweet comforter of all afflicted hartes, not
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8350:78"/> truſting in anie worke or merite of myne owne, but only in thy wonted mercie and goodnes. Theſe and other the like wordes did the holie virgin vſe in her praier (as ſhe declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to her ghoſtly Father) which ſhe powred out before God, rather with feruour of deſire and inward affection, then with outward noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and ſownd of voice. And our Lord, to moue her to further compaſſion, and to make her yet more earneſt in praier, gaue her to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and ſee, the euident and imminent peril that her wretched ſiſter was in: and ſhe heard it pronownced in plaine termes, that the iuſtice of God could not beare, but that ſuch an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate malice and hardnes of hart, muſt needes be puniſhed. The which horible ſentence, geuen vpon her ſiſter <hi>Palmerina</hi> (whoſe ſowles health ſhe tendred exceedingly) ſtrooke her to the verie hart ſo mightily, that ſhe fell downe to the grownd againe, and there lying proſtrate, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto almightie God after a moſt lamentable ſort, ſaying. O Lord God almightie, Father of mercies, and onlie helper in all extremities; I am right well contented, yea I moſt humbly craue it at thy hand, that thou wilt vowchſafe to laie all the paine dwe to this wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſynnes vpon my backe: puniſh me for them, for I am the cauſe of them, and not ſhe: Wherefore I moſt inſtantly beſeeche thee, beate me, but ſpare her. And with that ſhe raiſed vp her hart to God with a greater affiance, and ſaid
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8350:79"/> furthermore. O merciful Lord, I will neuer riſe out of this place, vntill thou ſhewe mercie to my ſiſter. Wherefore I here groane and crie vnto thee, O lord, euen from the verie botome of myne hart, beſeeching thee by thyne vnſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodnes, by thine infinite mercie, and by the price of thy moſt precious blood, ſhed for the rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption of mankind, that thou wilt not ſuffer my ſiſters ſoule to depart out of her bodie, vntill the tyme that thou haue graunted her the grace of due penance and contrition for all her ſynnes. Thus did the holie maid make interceſſion to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, for the recouery of her ſiſters ſoule: &amp; her praier was (as the euent ſhewed) of merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great force &amp; vertu. For the ſicke woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laie in extremes three daies and three nightes, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on continually in ſuch ſort that as manie as were preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, looked euerie hower, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſhould paſſe out of this wordle: (for they all ſaw, that ſhe was ſtaied in that paineful ſtate of life, not by any ſtrength of nature, but by ſome ſecret &amp; extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie power.) All the which tyme the deuout virgin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued in moſt earneſt &amp; ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t praiers for her, and neuer gaue ouer, vntil ſhe had with her teares and humilitie (as it were) wreſted the ſword of Gods iuſtice out of his almightie hand, and obteined for that wretched woman ſo much mercie &amp; grace, that ſhe might firſt ſee the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of her ſynnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then vnderſtand the dreadful decree of Gods iuſtice againſt her for the ſame, &amp; laſt of all be hartily ſorie &amp; repentant for her life
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:8350:79"/> paſt, with a ſure hope of forgiuenes by the mercy of God through the merites of the moſt precious blood &amp; death of our Sauiour Chriſt. This bleſſed alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was reuealed by God to the holie maid alſo: who vpon the vnderſtanding of the ſame, went foorthwith to her ſicke ſiſters chamber to comfort her. Whether when ſhe was come, the ſicke woman which was now verie weake in bodie, but well ſtrengthened in ſpirite, made ſignes of great reuerence and ioye: and partly with woordes (as well as ſhe could) partly with tokens and geſtures of bodie and countenance, ſhe lamented her vncharitable demeanour tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes her and beſought her of mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. That done ſhe made her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion with great humilitie and contrition &amp; ſo receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes &amp; rightes of holie Church, ſhe yealded vp her ſoule to God. At what tyme it pleaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God to ſhewe to the holie virgin what a blesful &amp; beautiful ſtate that ſaued ſowle was in: which (as ſhe declared afterwardes to her ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father) was ſo great, that no tongue of man is able to expreſſe it. And yet was not this that beawtie that ſhe ſhould receiue afterwardes in the bleſſe of heauen, but only that godlie ſtate, that the ſowle had in her firſt creation, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againe at the tyme of her Baptiſme. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaid our Lord to the holie maid. How ſaieſt thou, my deere daughter, is not this a faire and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſowle, which through thy paines and dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is now recouered out of the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of the enemie?
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8350:80"/> What man or woman would refuſe to take paines for the wynning of ſuch a beawtiful creature?

For this cauſe haue I ſhewed thee the beawtie of this ſowle, that hereafter thou mighteſt both thy ſelfe be the more earneſt about the wynnyng of ſowles, and alſo procure others to doe the like.

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8350:81"/> By reaſon whereof there was none fownd, that would attend vpon her in her ſickenes. The which thing when the holie maid vnderſtood, ſhe went out of hand to viſite her; and, ſeeing her vtterly forſaken and deſtitute of all ſuccour and comfort, ſhe made her ſelfe well aſſured, that the prouidence of God had reſerued that ſiſter for her keeping.

The holie maid therefore ſet her ſelfe to the ſeruice of that poore woman: ſhe tooke care for her, that ſhe might haue, whatſoeuer was neceſſarie or requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for a woman in that caſe; when tyme was, ſhe opened her ſore, &amp; clenſed it of all the fowle matter; ſhe was ſhed it and wypt it, and couered it againe with plaiſters and cleane clothes: and in all this, ſhe neuer ſhewed ſo much as one litle token of lothſomenes, but did euerie thing with ſuch diligence and cheerefulnes, that the ſicke ſiſter was aſtoined to ſee ſo great loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in a maid of thoſe yeares.

The which thing when ſhe perceiued, ſhe entred into a paſſing great choler and diſpleaſure againſt her owne ſkeymiſh bodie ane ſtomake, and ſaid to her ſelfe. Ah vile and wretched fleſh, doſt thou loath thy ſiſter, whom our Lord hath bought ſo deerely, euen with the price of his owne moſt precious blood? The daie maie come when thou alſo maieſt fall into the like ſickenes, or peraduenture worſe. As I am a Chriſtian woman thou ſhalt abide for it. And with that, ſhe bowed downe, and held her mowth and noſe ouer the ſore ſo long, vntill at the length it ſeemed, that ſhe had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her ſtomake, &amp; quite ouercome the ſkey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhnes, that ſhe felt before. All the which tyme he ſicke ſiſter cried out vnto her, and ſaid. Good daughter, ſtand vp: good daughter, geue ouer, caſt not thy ſelfe awaie: endanger not thy bodie with this infectuous ſauour.

He began to ſowe in the hart of the ſicke woman diuerſe and ſundrie ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes againſt her, by craftie meanes bringing her in great gelowſie and diſliking of all that ſhe did: by reaſon wherof in proceſſe of tyme ſhe waxed meruelous weerie of her, and might not well abide to ſee her.

Wherunto ſhe made anſwere with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and patience, ſaying no moe wordes, but only theſe. Truly, good mothers and ſiſters, by the grace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt I am a maid. And, whatſoeuer they ſaid to her, ſhe gaue them none other word to anſwere, but only this. Truly I am a maid. Truly I am a maid: neuer vtterring ſo much as one word, that might ſeeme to touch her accuſer. Vpon whom ſhe attended and ſerued with as great loue and diligence, as if there had neuer paſſed anie ſuch matter betweene them. And yet was ſhe ſorie at
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:8350:83"/> the verie hart, for the ſlaunder and infamie, that was raiſed vpon her. Wherefore, when ſhe had done, what was to be done about the ſicke wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe retired her ſelfe for comfort (as her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was in all aduerſites) into her chamber: and there, caſting her ſelfe downe proſtrate vpon the ground, ſhe opened the griefe of her hart to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, more with gronyng of hart, then with ſound of voice, after this maner. O almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, my deere Lord &amp; ſpowſe, thou knoweſt verie well, what a tender thing the good name of virgins is, (eſpecially of them that haue vowed their virginitie to thee) and how much ſubiecte they are to the violent ſtrokes of ſlawnderous tonges. And that was the cauſe, why thy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſedome diſpoſed, that thy moſt glorious mother ſhould be committed to the charge of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, who was called, and was in deed her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not for anie acte of matrimonie, but to keepe her name of virginitie from ſlander. Thou knoweſt, O Lord, that all this ſlawnder, that is raiſed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, is wrought by the father of lying: who hath done this, to withdrawe &amp; hinder me from this charitable woorke, that thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed me to doe, &amp; I haue willingly take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon me for thy loue. Wherefor I moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly beſeech thee, O my deere Lord, moſt mightie protectour of all innocentes, that thou wilt not ſuffer this wicked ſerpent, whom thou haſt troden vnder foote in the tyme of thy ſacred paſſion, to haue the maſtrie ouer me. When the holie maid had thus
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8350:83"/> made a long praier to our Lord, with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward gronyng and plentie of teares: behold, our Lord appeered to her, holding two crownes in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, one in his right hand of gold, all decked with ritch perles and precious ſtones, an other in his left hand of verie ſharpe thornes: &amp; ſaid theſe wordes vnto her. Deere daughter, it is ſo, that thou muſt needes be crowned with theſe two crownes at ſundry tymes. Chooſe therefor, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haue lieffer to be crowned with the ſharpe crowne of thorne in this life, and that other to be reſerued for thee in the life to come: or elswhether thou like better to haue this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie golden crowne in this life, &amp; that other ſharpe crowne in the life to come. To this demand the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble &amp; diſcrete virgin made anſwere after this maner. Lord, ſaid ſhe, thou knoweſt verie well, that I haue reſigned my will wholly to thee, &amp; haue made a full reſolution to doe all thinges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy direction: and therfore I dare not chooſe anie thing, vnleſſe I maie knowe, that the ſame ſhall ſtand with thy moſt bleſſed will and pleaſure. Neuertheles, becauſe thou haſt willed me to make anſwere concernyng this choiſe, that thou haſt here made vnto me, I ſaie thus: that I doe chooſe in this life euermore to be conformed and made like to thee, my Lord &amp; Sauiour, &amp; cherefully to beare Croſſes &amp; thornes for thy loue, as thou haſt done for myne. With that ſhe reached out her handes Iuſtely, and tooke the crowne of thornes of our Lordes handes,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:8350:84"/> and put the ſame vpon her owne head with ſuch a ſtrength and violence, that the thornes perced her head rownd about, in ſo much that for a long ſpace after ſhe felt a ſenſible paine in her head by the pricking of thoſe thornes, as ſhe declared afterwardes to her ghoſtlie Father. Then our Lord ſaid to her. Daughter, all thinges are in my power. And as I haue ſuffred this ſlawnder to be raiſed againſt thee by the deuel and his membres: ſo is it in my power to ceaſe the ſame, when I will. Continue thou therefore in that holie ſeruice that thou haſt begon, and geue no place to the enemie, that would let thee from all good workes. I will geue thee a perfecte victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer thyne enemie, and will bring to paſſe, that, whatſoeuer he hath imagined againſt thee, it ſhall all be turned vpon his owne head, to thy great ioye, and his great paine. Thus was ſhe well comforted againe, and ſo continued ſtill at the ſeruice of that ſicke woman. In this meane tyme the ſlaunderous rumour was bruted, and, came to her mothers eares. Who for her ſelfe made no doubt at all of her daughters innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie (for ſhe knewe manie thinges, that the worlde knewe not) and yet ſhe could not but take it verie heauelie, when ſhe heard tell that ſuch a ſlawnder was raiſed vpon her. The griefe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo ouercame her mynd, that ſhe flang to her daughter with great heat and vehemencie of ſpirite, and began with her after this maner. How often tymes haue I told thee, that thou
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8350:84"/> ſhouldeſt no more ſerue yonder ſtinging old croyne? See now, what reward ſhe geueth thee for all thy good ſeruice, ſhe hath brought vp a foule ſlaunder vpon thee emong all thy ſiſters: which God knoweth, whether thou ſhalt euer be able to rid thy ſelfe of, ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g as thou liueſt. If euer thou ſerue her againe after this daie, or if euer thou come, where ſhe is: neuer take me for thy mother. For I tell thee plaine, I will neuer knowe thee for my daughter. Theſe and other the like wordes did the mother vtter in great heate &amp; choler, whereat the daughter at the firſt was ſomewhat aſtoined. But after a litle tyme, when ſhe had gathered her ſelfe together, ſhe went to her mother, and kneeling downe before her with great reuerence, ſhe ſpake theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Sweete mother, thinke you, that our Lord would be pleaſed with vs if wee ſhould leaue the workes of mercie vndone, bicauſe our neigbour ſheweth him ſelfe vnthankeful towardes vs? When our Sauiour Chriſt hong on the Croſſe, and heard there the reprochful talke of that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful people rownd about, did he in regard of their cruel wordes geueouer the charitable worke of their redemption? Good mother, you knowe verie well, that if I ſhould leaue this old ſicke woman, ſhe were foorthwith in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to periſh for lacke of keeping: bicauſe ſhe ſhould not find anie, that would come neere her, &amp; do ſuch ſeruice, as is requiſite to be done about a woman in this caſe. And ſo ſhould I be the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8350:85"/> occaſion of her death. She is now a litle deceiued by the ghoſtlie enemie: but ſhe maie hereafter by the grace of God come to acknowledge her fault and be ſorie for the ſame. With ſuch wordes ſhe qualified her mothers mynd &amp; gate her bleſſing: and ſo returned againe to the ſeruice of the ſicke woman. About whom ſhe did all thinges with great diligence &amp; loue, neuer ſhewing neither in wordes nor in countina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſo much as anie token of diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tantio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or diſpleaſure. In ſo much that the ſicke ſiſter ſeeing her demeanour, was verie much aſtoined &amp; withal aſhamed of that ſhe had done, and ſo began to haue great ſorrowe at hart and repentance for the ſlaunder, that ſhe had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon her. Then alſo it pleaſed our Lord to ſhewe his mercie towardes his faithful ſpowſe, &amp; to reſtore her againe to her good fame &amp; eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after this maner. On a daie the holie mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de went to the ſicke ſiſters chamber to ſerue her, as ſhe was wont to doe. At what tyme, as ſhe was comyng towardes her bed, where ſhe laie, to doe ſome thing that was to be done about her; behold the ſicke woman ſawe a meruelous goodlie light commyng downe from heauen, which filled all her chamber, and was ſo beautifull and comfortable, that it made her vtterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all the paines of her diſeaſe. What that ſight might meane, ſhe could not conceiue. But, looking about her here and there, ſhe beheld the maidens face gloriouſly transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: the maieſtie wherof was ſo ſtrang, that ſhe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8350:85"/> ſeemed to her rather an Angel of heauen, then anie earthlie creature. And this beautiful light, enuironed the holie virgins bodie rownd about. The which brightnes the more the old woman beheld, the more did ſhe condemne the malice of her owne hart and tongue, in that ſhe had conceiued and vttered ſo fowle matter, as ſhe had done, againſt ſuch an excellent and pure creature, as the holie maid then ſhewed to be. This viſion continued a good tyme: and at the length, when it ceaſed, left the ſicke woman both in ſorrowe, and alſo in comfort. In ſorrowe, bicauſe on the one ſide ſhe ſawe, what a heynous ſynne ſhe had committed in diſſamyng that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent virgin. In comfort, bicauſe on the other ſide ſhe ſawe the mercie of God freely and franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kely offred vnto her. The which thing ſo molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her hart, that with much ſobbing &amp; weeping ſhe confeſſed her fault to the holie maid, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought her of pardon. When the good virgin ſawe the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble maner of her repentance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, ſhe likewiſe verie amiably tooke the old woman in her armes, &amp; kiſſed her, and ſpake very ſweet and comfortable wordes vnto her, ſaying. Good mother, I haue no diſpleaſure in the worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de againſt you, but only againſt our enemie the Deuel, by whoſe malice &amp; ſuttiltie, I knowe, all this is wrought: but, rather I haue to thanke you with all my hart, for you haue put me in mynd to haue a more careful and vigilant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to my ſelfe, and ſo doing you haue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8350:86"/> turned the malicious drifte of the feend to my further good and commoditie. With ſuch ſweet ſpeeches ſhe comforted the ſicke ſiſter, and then ſhe ſet her ſelfe to doe all ſuch ſeruices, as were wont to be done about her. And when ſhe had done all, ſhe tooke her leaue verie gently (as her maner was) and ſo retired her ſelfe to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, to geue God thankes ſo the proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, that ſhe had had in this matter, and to enter into her accuſtomed exerciſe of praier &amp; medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. In this meane tyme the old woman, who had a great care to reſtore the innocent virgin to her good name againe, when anie of thoſe came to her, before whom ſhe had made that ſlaunderous report, tooke occaſion to vnburthen her conſcience, and confeſſed openly with great lamentation and teares, that whatſoeuer diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie ſhe had anie tyme reported by that holie maid, ſhe had ben induced to report it by the crafte of the deuel, &amp; not by anie thing that euer ſhe ſawe or knewe in her. And therfore ſhe cried them all mercie, and beſought them for chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to forgeue her. She affirmed furthermore, that ſhe was able to make good proofe, that the holie maid was not only free from all ſuſpicion of anie vncleannes of bodie, but alſo endued with manie high &amp; ſingular graces of God, and that ſhe was in deed a verie pure virgin and a Saincte. Thus much, ſaid ſhe; I ſpeake not vpon hereſaie or opinion, but vpon verie certaine knoweledge. Then certaine of the elder and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8350:86"/> ſadder women talked with her ſecretly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to vnderſtand, what certaine tokens and knowledge of holines ſhe had in the maid. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reupon ſhe declared vnto them ſo much as hath ben here receited before. And ſaid furthermore, verie conſtantly and with great feruour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, that in all her life tyme ſhe neuer knewe, what true ſweetnes of ſowle and ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort meant, vntill that tyme, when ſhe ſawe the holie maid ſo transfourmed and enuironed ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und about with that heauenly and vnſpeakeable light: the beawtie and brightnes wherof was ſo great, that no tongue was able to expreſſe it. This teſtimonie of the ſicke woman was ſpread allouer the citie: by reaſon wherof the fame of the bleſſed virgin, and the opinion of her rare vertue and holines was ſo much increaſed, as the malice of the deuel had thought to haue obſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the ſame by this falſe treacherie. But in all this, as ſhe was nothing deiected by the raiſing of that ſlanderous reporte: ſo was ſhe nothing puffed vp with pride for all the honour that the wordle gaue her: but acknowledging humblie all vertues and holines to be the gyftes of God, ſhe continued ſtill in her foremer ſtate,, at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of that ſicke woman. But the ghoſtlie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, whoſe malice ceaſeth not, though he ſawe, that he had had verie euel lucke in all that he had euer attempted againſt her before yet like an earneſt gameſter, he thought, he would aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture one caſt more, as it were vpon deſperation.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8350:87"/> On a tyme, as the holie maid was dreſſing the old womans ſore, by the malicious working of the feend, there iſſued out of it ſuch a loathſome and horrible ſtench, that ſhe was vpon the point to haue caſt vp all that was in her bodie. The which when ſhe ſawe perceuing that it was the practiſe of that venemous ſerpent, ſhe entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an earneſt diſpleaſure againſt her owne fleſh, and ſpake to her ſelfe with great vehemencie of ſpirite, ſaying. Ah wretched and caraine fleſh, doſt thou loath thyne euen Chriſtian? I ſhall make thee, not only to endure the ſauour of it, but alſo to reciue it within thee With that ſhe tooke all the wasſhing of the ſore, together with the corrupt matter and filth; and going aſide put it all into cup, and drancke it vp luſtely. And in ſo doing, ſhe ouercame at one tyme, both the ſkeymiſhnes of her owne ſtomake, and malice of the Deuel. This was told afterwardes to her ghoſtlie Father in her preſence, and ſhe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it was all true; and ſaid furthermore, that ſhe could not remember, that ſhe had euer eaten or droncken ſuch a pleaſant and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate meate or drincke, as that ſeemed to be, in all her life. The next night folowing after this glorious victorie, our Sauiour Chriſt appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her, and ſhowed her his handes, feete and ſide, &amp; in them imprinted the fiue woundes, of his moſt bitter paſſion, &amp; ſaid vnto her. Deere daughter, manie are the battailes, that thou haſt ſuſteined for my loue: and great are the victories
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:8350:87"/> that thou haſt atchieued through my grace and aſſiſtance. For the which I beare thee great good will and fauour. But eſpecially that drincke, that thou tookeſt yeſter daie for my ſake, liked me paſſingly well: in the which, bicauſe thou haſt not only deſpiſed the delite of the fleſh, caſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thy backe the opinion of the wordle, and vtterly ſubdued thyne owne nature: I will geue thee a drincke that ſhall paſſe in ſweetnes and pleaſure all the licours, that the wordle is wont or able to geue. With that he reached out his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, and tooke her about the necke, and brought her mouth ſoftely to the ſacred wound of his ſide, and ſaid vnto her. Drincke daughter, drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke thy fill at the verie founteine of life. This drincke, ſhall repleniſh thy ſoule with vnſpekea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſweetnes in ſuch ſort, that it ſhall abound and ouerſlowe into thy bodie alſo, which thou haſt ſo vtterly deſpiſed for my loue. Then the holie maid ſet her mouth to, with great greedines, and drewe out of that founteine of euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ſaluation the licour of life. And ſo ſhe continued ſucking a good while, not only with the mouth of her bodie, but alſo (and that much more) with the mouth of her ſoule: vntill at the length (when his holie will and pleaſure was) ſhe gaue ouer, feeling her ſelfe in a meruelous blesful ſtate. For ſhe had dronc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke her fill, and yet was nothing glutted, but rather thirſtie and deſirous to drincke ſtill:
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:8350:88"/> Which thirſt and deſire was no paine at all to her, but rather a paſſing great delite &amp; pleaſure. After this tyme the holie maid was ſo repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with heauenlie grace that ſhe neither did, nor might eate, her bodilie meate in ſuch ſort, as ſhe was wont to doe before.</p>

                  <p>AFter that the faithful diſciple of Chriſt had thus by the grace of God ouercome diuerſe and ſundrie tentations; being now thoroughly tried like fine gold in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of tribulation, there remained nothing els, but only to receiue the crowne of iuſtice in life euerlaſting. But bicauſe the diuine prouidence of God had ſo diſpoſed of her, that ſhe ſhould yet remaine in this life a litle while, for the benefite of others: (in the which tyme ſhe was not able to receiue the fruition of that endles bleſſe that is prepared for the tyme to come: and yet our Lord of his goodnes would not ſuffer her to continue anie longer in this preſent life without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or ſtate of bleſſednes) he gaue her a certaine taſt or pledge of that blesful ſtate, that ſhe was to receiue in the other life, euen in this vale of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:8350:88"/> And he did it after this maner. On a tyme, while ſhe was praying in her chamber, our Lord appeered vnto her, and ſpake after this maner. My deere daughter <hi>Catherine,</hi> I geue thee now to vnderſtand, that the reſt of thyne abode in this wordle ſhalbe full of ſuch ſtrang and vnwonted gyftes of my grace, that it ſhall cauſe diuerſe and ſundrie effectes in the hartes of men. Simple and ignorant perſones ſhalbe greatly aſtoined to ſee the thinges, that ſhalbe wrought by thee. Carnal men, and ſuch as haue litle expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in ſpiritual matters, ſhalbe in danger to fall quite from their faith. Yea and manie of thoſe alſo, that are good and vertuous, ſeeing certaine tokens of my paſſing great loue towar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des thee (ſuch as haue not lightly ben heard of) and withal the wonderful ſtrangenes of the thinges, that thou ſhalt worke, ſhall ſuppoſe, that all is but deceite and illuſion. For I will endue thy ſoule with ſuch abundance of grace, that it ſhall redound into thy bodie alſo: by reaſon wherof thou ſhalt lead ſuch a meruelous kind of life, as the wordle hath not oftentymes ſeene or heard tell of. Againe, I will enkendle in thine hart ſuch a fyerie zeale, both of myne honour and of the ſaluation of ſoules, that thou ſhalt in a maner forget thyne owne kind, and alter the wonted order of thy whole conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For thou ſhalt not from hence foorth ſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the compaine of men and women, as thou haſt hitherto but rather to wynne them to God,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8350:89"/> thou ſhalt preſſe in emong them, and labour to the vttermoſt of thy power. Of this maner of life manie a one ſhall take occaſion of ſlaunder and offence, and thou ſhalt be gaineſaid of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: that the thoughtes of manie hartes maie be opened. But in anie caſe, ſee that thou be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing afraid or troubled with anie of theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: For I will be with thee alwaies, and will deliuer thee from lying lippes and ſlaunderous tongues. Folowe therfore freely the guydance of my holie ſpirite, and labour diligently in this charitable woorke, wherin I haue apointed thee. For by thee I haue determined, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer manie ſoules out of the dragons mouth, and to bring them to my euerlaſting reſt in heauen. Theſe and other the like wordes ſpake our Lord to her, and repeted the ſame againe and againe, and ſpecially that word, where he bad her, that ſhe ſhould not be afraid or diſmaid. Wherunto the holie maid made anſwere with great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and perfecte obedience ſaying. Thou art my Lord and my God, and I thy creature and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy hand maid: thy will be done in all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Only this, O Lord, I beſeech thee, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me according to the multitude of thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and helpe me. And with that the viſion ceaſed: and the bleſſed virgin conferred thoſe comfortable wordes of our Sauiout in her hart, eaſting earneſtly with her ſelfe, what that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious alteration might meane. From that tyme foreward the grace of God increaſed daily in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8350:89"/> her hart ſo much &amp; the gyftes of the holie Ghoſt repleniſhed her ſoule in ſuch aboundant maner, that ſhe was her ſelfe aſtoined at it; and, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that paſſing great increaſe of ſpiritual ioye and comfort that ſhe felt in her ſoule, her bodie, being not able to beare it, waxed feeble &amp; faint. Her hart was wholly caried vp into God, and that with ſuch a veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie and feruour of loue, that ſhe could not endure anie tyme without thinking and meditating vpon his moſt noble workes, and endles mercies towardes her ſelfe and all mankind. The force of the which loue, ſo ouercame the natural powers of her bodie, that ſhe languiſhed and decaied in ſtrength: and could find none other remedie for that ſickenes, but only to runne vnto God with an amorous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to powre out her hart befor him with great aboundance of teares, and ſo to renewe her ſelfe as it were in the forge and fyer of loue. At the length, it pleaſed our Lord to geue her to vnderſtand by the ſecret inſtincte of his holie ſpirite, that the moſt ſoueraigne medicine for that diſeaſe was, often tymes to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament of the aulter. Where ſhe ſhould haue the ioyful fruition of her loue, not in ſuch ſort, as ſhe ſhould haue it afterwardes in the bleſſe of heauen, but yet ſo, as that ſhe ſhould find her ſelfe ſatisfied in ſome dergree for the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. Now, after that ſhe had vſed for a certaine tyme to comunicate euerie daie (as ſhe did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſhe were letted by ſickenes or by ſome other
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8350:90"/> neceſſarie occaſion) ſhe had at the length ſuch a paſſing great longing and (as it were) an impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient deſire to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, that if ſhe were enforced by anie ſuch vrge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t neceſſitie to abſtaine but only one daie, it ſeemed, that her body fainted se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſibly &amp; failed: forſomuch as, being now fully accorded with the ſoule, it had aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the natural powers &amp; ſenſes, and ſo receiued nouriſhment and ſuſtentation, not of the meates that the bodie is wont to be fed withal (which did her more harme then good) but of the foode of the ſoule, which is the grace of God: which grace was ſo abo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant in her ſoule, that it redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into her bodie, and by miracle tempered that waſting heat, that is wont to conſume the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical moiſture. Her ghoſtlie Father, examinyng her vpon this point, aſked, whether ſhe had euer anie appetite to eate or no. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere, that ſhe was fully ſatisfied with the holy Sacrament, and had none other appetite. Then he aſked her yet further, in caſe by occaſion ſhe abſteined from receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament, whether ſhe were then hungrie or no. To that likewiſe ſhe anſwered and ſaid, that the only preſence of the Sacrament, did ſatisfie her, and not only the Sacrament, but the prieſt alſo, that had touched the Sacrament, did ſatifie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her in ſuch ſort, that ſhe could not ſo much as thinke of anie other meate. And in deed it was well knowen to as manie as liued with her from the begynnyng of Lent vntill the Aſcenſion
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8350:90"/> daie, ſhe continued in verie good liking without receiuing anie maner of bodily food or ſuſtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in the worlde. And vpon that daie by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, ſhe tooke only a litle bread and a fewe herbes: for her ſtomake might not brooke anie deintie or fine meates. After that ſhe obſerued a ſimple maner of faſting for a tyme, vntill at the length by litle and litle, ſhe came againe to her old maner of abſtinence, which was to eate nothing at all. And ſo ſhe paſſed ouer her life in a continual and euident miracle, verifying that ſaying of the holie Scripture, that man liueth not only by bread, but by euerie word that cometh out of our Lordes mowth. Her ghoſtlie Father teſtified, that he ſawe her him ſelfe (and that not once or twiſe, but often tymes) when, continuyng after this ſort with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anie maner of ſuſtenance, vnleſſe it were a litle water, ſhe became ſo weake, that as manie as were about her looked euerie hower, when ſhe would geue vp the ghoſt. At what tyme, if occaſion were miniſtred to wynne a ſowle to God, or to doe anie other charitable worke to the honour of God, they all ſawe to their great aſtoniſhment, that ſhe was ſodainly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the ſtate of her bodie in ſuch ſort, that ſhe was able to riſe and goe without anie token of weakenes or weerines, and alſo to endure great labour in doing that good worke, that ſhe tooke in hand for Gods ſake. And thoſe that went with her, hauing their perfecte health and

Which made them all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that it was the almightie power of God, that ſuſteined her, and not anie naturall force.</p>

Some ſaid, that ſhe made her ſelfe better then our bleſſed Ladie &amp; the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, yea better then our Sauiour Chriſt him ſelfe; who (as the holie ſcripture recordeth) did eate and drincke. Some other alleaged the rules of ſpiritual life, which doe preciſely forbid anie Religious perſone to folowe anie ſingular maner of life. Some other reaſoned and ſaid, that vertue conſiſted in the meane, and that all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie was to be ſuſpected of vice. Some ſaid, that ſhe was beguyled by the Deuel: ſome other ſaid in plaine termes, that ſhe was an hypocrite, and perſwaded them ſelues, that ſhe did faſt openly to bleere the eyes of the worlde, but that ſhe had good morſels in corners, which the worlde knew not of. Thus did euerie bodie thinke and report of her, (as it is wont to happen in ſuch caſes) not as they found her better or worſe, but as they found them ſelues better or worſe diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But, to make anſwere to theſe vaine ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8350:92"/> and falſe reportes briefely, it is to be knowen, that all men, eſpecially Religious and ſpiritual perſones, if they haue not vtterly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen or done their beſt to ouer throwe ſelfe-loue in them ſelues, but do labour ſtill to gett the vaine eſtimation of the worlde, are in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ouerthrowen by their owne ambitious mynd; and ſo being blinded with ſuch malice, to enuie the gyftes and graces of God in others, namely if they be ſuch excellent and ſingular gyftes, as maie ſeeme in anie degree to make their owne qualities to ſheweleſſe in the opinion of men. Such perſones are wont commonly to couer their owne malice with the cloke of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine zeale, which they pretend to haue to the honour of God and edifying of ſowles: vnder the which couert they will goe about to obſcure and ſlaunder the gyftes of God in their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, geuing the worlde to vnderſtand, that, whatſoeuer they ſee in them, all is but the deceite of the Deuel, illuſions, counterfeicting, hipocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or lacke of diſcretion. But in the end ſuch malice is wont to diſcouer it ſelfe, as this againſt the holie virgin doth, eſpecially if it be examined and tried, by the rules of holie Scriptures and examples of other Sainctes, of whom we are well aſſured, that they were in the like caſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the ſpirite of God. To them therefore, that ſaie, that ſhe preferred her ſelfe before our bleſſed Ladie, the Apoſtles, and Chriſt him ſelfe, in that ſhe obſerued ſuch a ſtreight kind of faſt,

If they will adde furthermore and ſaie, that this holie maides caſe is not altogether like to thoſe auncient Fathers; forſomuch as, though, they liued a meruelous ſtreight kind of life, and faſted farre aboue the common courſe of men, yet did they eate ſomewhat, and faſted not ſimply from all maner of bodilie ſuſtenance: to that it maie be anſwered, that ſhe had (euen for that point) the example of <hi>Marie Magdalen,</hi> who liued in a rocke of the ſea for the ſpace of thirtie yeares together, and neuer eate nor drancke in all that tyme. And yet was ſhe neuer thought to be better, then our bleſſed Ladie, which did both eate and drincke. To them, that alleage the rules of ſpiritual life, which doe expreſſely forbid all ſingularitie, it maie eaſily be anſwered: that no man ought to take ſuch order of life vpon him ſelfe, without a verie good and aſſured warrant from God:
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:8350:93"/> but, if he be commaunded by God to take anie ſuch ſingular maner of life vpon him, he maie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not refuſe it in reſpecte of the ſingularitie: for that were to refuſe the gyfte and grace of God. The like anſwere maie be made to them alſo, that reaſon and ſaie, that all extremities are to be eſchewed, and only the meane to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced. For it is a moſt certaine ground, that whatſoeuer almightie God willeth, can not be taken for an extremitie: forſomuch as his will is to vs a moſt true and infallible rule: by the which rule he meaſureth to euerie one, accordingly as he ſeeth moſt expedient. And manie tymes, what we imagin to be to one man a great extremitie, that knoweth he to be to an other man the verie iuſt meane, wherin conſiſteth vertue. As for thoſe that ſaid, that ſhe was deceiued by the Deuel, there needeth none anſwere to be geuen: forſomuch as the thing it ſelfe anſwereth them ſufficiently. For admit, that ſhe might be deceiued by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie (whoſe crafte in deed is verie ſuttle) yet would I faine learne of them, who it was, that kept her bodie ſo long tyme in her natural force and ſtrength. If they anſwere and ſaie, that it was the Deuell: then will I aſke them againe, who that was, that preſerued her ſowle in ſuch ſpirituall ioye and peace, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at that tyme, when ſhe was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all outward delite and comfort. This inward comfort and peace is vndoubtedly
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:8350:94"/> the fruite of the holie Ghoſt, and maie in no wiſe be aſcribed to the Deuel. Laſt of all, to come to them, that of a wicked malice ſlaundered the bleſſed virgin of hypocriſie and vaine glorie, I thinke it not ſo expedient to ſhape them an anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, as to geue them good counſel. I would wiſh all ſuch to be better aduiſed, what they ſpeake againſt Gods ſeruantes, and what iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement they geue concernyng the wonderfull workes of God in his Sainctes.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8350:94"/> For in truth I would eate with a good will, if I could.

By ſuch ſweet wordes ſhe hoped well to haue ſtaied tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe malicious tonges.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8350:95"/> then to ſuffer ſuch paines, how ſoeuer they tooke it, and whatſoeuer ſlaunders they raiſed vpon her. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere with a ſmyling countenance, ſaying. Father, how thinke you? Is it not better for me to diſcharge the debt of my ſynnes after this maner in this preſent life, then to differre the payment of the ſame in farre greater paines to the life to come? would you, that I ſhould flee Gods Iuſtice, or rather (to ſpeake more to the purpoſe) that I ſhould not accepte this goodlie occaſion, that is offred me here, to ſatiſfie Gods Iuſtice with ſuch temporal paines? Surely, Father, I take it for a great grace and benefite of God, that he will vouchſafe thus to chaſtice me here for my ſynnes; and not reſerue the ſame to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in the other life. To this her ghoſtlie Father could ſaie nothing, and therfore he held his peace.

                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:8350:96"/> O God, create in me a cleane hart, and renue a right ſpirite in my bowels: ſhe made a ſpecial petition to him, that he would vouchſafe to take awaie her owne hart and will, and geue her an other newe hart and will, that were wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his holie will.

Afterwardes being in talke with her ghoſtlie Father, emong other thinges ſhe ſaid to him, that ſhe had no hart in her bodie, When her Confeſſeur heard thoſe wordes, he laughed at her, and began after a ſort to rebuke her for ſo ſaying. But ſhe affirmed conſtantly, that ſo it was: and for confirmation of the ſame declared, how our Sauiour had taken it out with his owne hand. All the which talke perſwaded him nothing at all. How is it poſſible, ſaid he, that anie man ſhould liue without a hart? yee ſaie truly, Father (ſaid ſhe) vnto man it is in deed impoſſible: but vnto God there is nothing impoſſible. Within a fewe daies after this, it chaunced her to goe to a certaine Chapple of the Friars preachers, where the ſiſters of penance were wont to kneele.

Howbeit he did it in ſuch ſort, that there remained euer afterwardes a certaine marke or ſcarre, as it were, of a wound healed: as ſhe declared oftentymes to her ghoſtly Father, and manie of her ſiſters ſawe it with their eyes.

                  <p>AFter that this holie maid was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ſuch great abondance of verie ſingular graces and gyftes, it pleaſed almightie God to reuele vnto her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundrie high myſteries, of the which this was one.

Daughter, ſaid he, what thing deſireſt thou? Wherunto ſhe made anſwere, and ſaid. Lord, thou knoweſt better then I, what thing is moſt behoueful for me. And of my ſelfe, thou knoweſt, I haue no will nor hart, but only thy will, and thy hart.

                  <p>THIS holie maid, from the tyme that ſhe was thus endued with newe graces, vntill the xxxiij. yeare of her age (at what tyme ſhe departed out of this life) was ſo wholly occupied in diuine comtemplations, that in all that tyme ſhe neuer needed anie bodilie
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:8350:99"/> ſuſtenance. And in thoſe contemplations her ſoule was ſo mightely drawen vp to heauenlie thinges, that her bodie alſo was by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of the ſpirite, taken vp often tymes withal, and ſuſpended in the ayer. At which tymes ſhe ſawe manie wonderful thinges, and ſpake manie high wordes of heauenlie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were heard of diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie perſones. On a tyme her ghoſtlie Father, ſeeing her ſo rauiſhed from her bodilie ſenſes, and hearing her ſpeake certaine wordes ſoftely to her ſelfe, came neere to hearken what ſhe ſaid. And ſtanding by her, he heard her ſpeake theſe wordes diſtinctly in latine: <hi>Vidi arcana Dei,</hi> that is. I haue ſeene the ſecrets of God. And ſhe repeted the ſame wordes often tymes <hi>Vidi ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana Dei.</hi> Her ghoſtlie Father afterwardes being verie deſirous to knowe, what ſhe meant by thoſe wordes, and whie ſhe repeted them ſo often, aſked her after this maner. Good mother, ſaid he, I praie you, tell me, whie you repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe wordes ſo often. What is the cauſe, whie you will not declare your ſecrets to me now as you were wont to doe? To that ſhe anſwered and ſaid, that ſhe might not ſpeake otherwiſe: whie ſo, ſaid he? whie maie you not declare the thinges, that our Lord reuealeth vnto you, as well now, as you were wont to doe? Good Father, ſaid ſhe, I ſhould haue as great a conſcience, if I ſhould declare the high miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that almightie God hath now reueled

                  <p>IT chaunced alſo the ſame yeare on <hi>S. Laurence</hi> daie, that this holie maid, comyng to the Church to heare Maſſe, ſet her ſelfe downe neere to the Aulter, as her maner was, that ſhe might the better ſee the holie Sacrament. And kneeling there deuoutly in her praiers, ſhe brake out into weeping and ſobbing ſo much, that her ghoſtlie Father came to her &amp; warned her, that ſhe ſhould refraine ſo much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for not moleſting the prieſt at Maſſe. Wherupon, like a meeke and obedient daughter, ſhe remoued her ſelfe farther from the Aulter, and made her humble praier to our Lord, that he would vouchſafe to illuminate her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours hart, that he might ſee and vnderſtand, that ſuch violent motions of the ſpirite, might not be witholden and kept in by the ſtrength of man: and her priaer was not vaine. For it pleaſed God to make her ghoſtlie Father to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand perfectly by experience, that ſuch fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of ſpirite could not be ſo kept in, but that the force of diuine loue would needes breake out. The which when he vnderſtood, he neuer rebuked her afterwardes for anie ſuch matter. Now, kneeling after this maner farre of from
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8350:100"/> the Aulter, ſhe groned in her hart, and manie tymes alſo brake out into wordes, and ſaid after a languiſhing and ruthful maner. I would faine receiue the bodie of my Lord and Redeemer. I would faine receiue the bodie of my Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. One tyme, as ſhe was ſo ſo crying, behold, our Lord appeered vnto her with the wound of his ſide all open, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging her mowth to the ſame, ſaid. Receiue of my fleſh, and drincke of my blood ſo much as thou wilt. With that ſhe ſucked greedily, and tooke ſo much, that it ſeemed to her, that for verie pure loue ſhe was at the point of death, by reaſon of the paſſing great ſweetnes, that ſhe felt in her hart. The ſelfe ſame yeare vpon <hi>S. Alexius</hi> daie, this holie maid made her praier to God, that he would vowchſafe to graunt her a feruent and burnyng deſire to receiue his moſt holie bodie and blood. At what tyme ſhe vnderſtood by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, that on the morowe ſhe ſhould receiue without all doubt. For ſhe had ben forbiden for certaine reſpectes, that ſhe ſhould not receiue ſo often. When ſhe had that comfortable reuela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe praied againe to our Lord, that he would vowchſafe to clenſe her hart againſt the tyme of receiuing, that ſhe might receiue the more worthily &amp; to her greater profite. Behold, while ſhe was ſo praying, ſhe felt a certaine raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne comyng downe into her ſoule, in maner of a great abondant flood, not of water or of anie other ſuch licour, but of blood myngled with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:8350:101"/> fyer: which (as it ſeemed to her) clenſed her ſoule ſo mightely, that the ſtrength and operation of the ſame redounded into the bodie, and clenſed it alſo. After this on the morowe, ſhe was ſo extremely ſicke; that to her ſeemyng ſhe was not able to moue one foote, though the worlde had lyen on it. All the which not withſtanding ſhe doubted nothing of the promiſe made vnto her by our Lord: but with a ful affiance in him, ſet her ſelfe in the waie towardes the Church. Whither when ſhe was come, ſhe kneeled downe in a chappell beſides an Aulter, and beſought almightie God with great inſtance, that her ghoſtlie Father might come and ſaie Maſſe there. (For ſhe had a ſpecial inhibition, not to receiue at anie other prieſtes hand.) And ſhe vnderſtood by reuelation, that almightie God had graunted her that petition alſo. Now, while ſhe was thus attending there for the performance of all theſe comfortable promiſes, her ghoſtlie Father, who before found ſmall diſpoſition in him ſelfe to ſaie Maſſe that daie, &amp; knewe not of her being there, was ſodainly touched at the hart with a verie ſtrange feruour and deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherupon he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared him ſelfe to Maſſe, and went to the ſame Aulter, wher the holy maid was (at which Aulter he was neuer wont to ſaie Maſſe at other tymes.) When he came thither and found her there, attending his comyng and deſiring to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, he vnderſtood, that it was our Lord, that had moued him, to ſaie Maſſe that daie, and to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8350:101"/> chooſe that Aulter contrarie to his accuſtomed maner. He ſaid Maſſe, and at the end (as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is) he came to miniſter the bleſſed Sacrament to her at the Aulters end. While ſhe was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, her ghoſtlie Father beheld her, and ſawe her face all red, and ſhynyng, and bedewed with great aboundance of teares: wherat he was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſly aſtoined. And ſhe, by receiuing the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament at that tyme, was ſo repleniſhed with the ioyous preſence of our Lord, and ſo mightely drawen inward by the vnſpeakeable ſweetnes that ſhe felt in him, that all the daie after ſhe might not ſpeake ſo much as one word to anie creature. On the next daie, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour aſked her what ſhe eiled, and what the cauſe was, ſhe had ſuch a goodlie ſhynyng read in her face the daie before, while ſhe was receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament. To whom ſhe anſwered and ſaid. Father, of what coulour my face was at that tyme, I knowe not. But this I knowe verie well. When I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie wretch receiued that bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at your hand, it drewe me into it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a ſort, that all other thinges, ſauing it alone, waxed lothſome vnto me, not only temporal thinges and delites of the worlde, but alſo all other comfortes and pleaſures, were they neuer ſo ſpiritual. Wherupon I made my humble praier to our Lord, that he would take all ſuch comfortes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites from me, that I might take pleaſure
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:8350:102"/> in none other thing, but only in him. I beſought him alſo, that he would vouchſafe to take awaie my will, and geue me his will. The which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition he graunted me, and ſaid after this maner. Behold, deere daughter, now I geue thee my will, by the vertue whereof thou ſhalt be ſo ſtrong, that whatſoeuer ſhall happen vnto thee from this tyme foreward, thou ſhalt neuer be altered or moued, but ſhalt continue euermore in one ſtate. She declared yet furthermore to her Confeſſour, and ſaid. Father, ſaid ſhe, will you knowe, how our Lord ſerued me the laſt daie? for ſooth he dalied with me, euen as a mother is wont to dalie with her child, whom ſhe loueth tenderly. She will ſet her child ſome tymes a good waie from her, when ſhe myndeth to ſhewe him her tette: and there will ſhe ſuffer him to ſtand and crie after it. All the which tyme ſhe taketh pleaſure to laugh at the fondnes of the child. At the lenght, when ſhe hath ſuffred him to crie a good while, ſhe runneth to him with a laughing cheere, &amp; clyppeth him in her armes, huggeth and kiſſeth him, and ſo geueth him the tette. In like maner did our Lord with me; He ſhewed me the bleſſed wound in his ſide, and made, as it were, a certaine tender of the ſame vnto me: (but yet a farre of.) The which I ſeeing, for the great deſire that I had to put my mowth vnto it out of hand, wept abondantly. Our Lord ſuffred me to weepe, and ſeemed to take pleaſure in it. At the length, when I had
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:8350:102"/> wept a good while, he came to me with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous ſweete and cheereful countenance, and tooke my ſoule in his armes, and put my mouth to his bleſſed wound. Where, by reaſon of the greedie deſire, that I had, my ſowle entred in all wholly, and ſucking there at will, drewe out ſuch vnſpeakeable ſweetnes, and withal ſuch a great knowledge of his diuinitie and godhead, that, whoſo were able to conceiue it, would be aſtoined to conſider, how it was poſſible for my hart not to breake, feeling and receiuing ſuch aboundance of loue into it, as it did at that tyme. And he would meruaile now alſo, to thinke, how it were poſſible for me to ſuſtaine life, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſuch a continual flamyng fyer of charitie in my hart, as I feele.</p>

                  <p>THe ſame yeare, vpon the 18. daie of Auguſt, when ſhe was to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, ſhe ſaid with great feruour and deuotion theſe wordes: Lord, I am not worthie, that thou ſhouldeſt enter into my bodie. And our Lord made her anſwere againe: but I am worthie, that thou ſhouldeſt enter into me. And ſo receiuing the bleſſed Sacrament, it ſeemed to her, that her ſoule entred into him, and he into her ſoule, euen as a fiſh entreth into the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:8350:103"/> water into the fiſh. And with that ſhe felt her ſelfe ſo mightely drawen vp into almightie God, that the powers of her bodie failing her, ſhe had much a doe to returne home to her chamber; whether when ſhe was come, ſhe laied her ſelfe downe vpon her hard bed of boordes, and laie there for a good ſpace like a ſtone without anie mouing. At the length her bodie was taken vp in the aier, and there hong for an other ſpace, in the preſence of three perſones, that bare witnes of all that happened at that tyme: and ſo comyng downe againe, ſhe began, as it were, to awake out of a dead ſleepe; and, lying verie weake and feeble vpon her bed, ſhe ſpake ſoftely manie ſweet wordes, and vttered much good mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of high contemplations, which cauſed as manie as were preſent to weepe. Emong other wordes, that ſhe ſpake, ſhe praied for manie perſones, and for ſome ſpecially, namely for her Confeſſour: who was at that tyme in the Church, and had no mynd of anie thing, that might moue him to deuotion, and yet of a ſuddaine found in him ſelfe, ſuch a ſtrange and wonderful feruour of deuotion, as he neuer felt the like in his whole life before: wherat he had great wonder. While he was thus caſting with him ſelfe, what that ſtrange and ſoddaine alteration might meane, one of the ſiſters, that had heard and ſeene the whole proceſſe of the matter, came in to him, and ſaid; Father, ſiſter <hi>Catherine</hi> hath praied for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8350:103"/> you verie much this daie, at ſuch an hower. When he heard that, he vnderſtood foorthwith, that her praier was the cauſe of all that gracious alteration in him ſelfe. Then he aſked that other ſiſter, what maner of praier the holie maid had made. And ſhe tolde him, that ſhe had praied for him and for other, that our Lord would vouchſafe to graunt then euerlaſting life. She tould him furthermore, that when the holie maid had made this praier, ſhe ſtretched out her hand, and beſought our Lord, to graunt her this petition. And ſo taking in her hand againe ſhe ſeemed to make, as though it had ben verie ſore, and ſaid with great ſighing theſe wordes. O Lord, worſhipped maieſt thou be; For ſo was ſhe wont to ſaie, ſo often as ſhe felt anie griefe in her bodie. When her Confeſſour heard all this, he went foorthwith to her lodging, and praied her, that ſhe would declare all her viſion to him. She like an obedient daughter declared vnto him the whole viſion in ſuch ſort, as it is deſcribed here before. And when ſhe came to that point, where ſhe praied for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpecial perſones, ſhe ſaid to him. Father, when I praied for you and for other, that our Lord would vouchſafe to graunt you euerlaſting life, it pleaſed his goodnes to geue me an aſſured comfort in my hart, that in deed ſo it ſhould be. With that I beſought him that he would graunt me ſome token of the certaintie therof: not that I doubted

All the which tyme her Confeſſour with diuerſe others a waited there, to ſee, what would become of her, and to heare ſome ſpiritual and comfortable wordes of her, as they were wont to doe commonly, when ſhe came to her ſelfe
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:8350:104"/> againe. Sodainly as they beheld her, the bodie, that laie proſtrate vpon the ground, was raiſed vp, and ſhe kneeled vpon her knees, ſtrethching vp her armes and handes, &amp; ſhewing in her face a meruelous goodlie and cleere brightnes. When ſhe had kneeled after this maner a good while, at the length ſhe fell downe ſodainly, like one that had receiued a deadlie wound: and ſoone after that ſhe was reſtored againe to her bodilie ſenſes. Then ſhe caled for her ghoſtly Father, and ſaid ſecretly vnto him theſe wordes; Father, I geue you to vnderſtand for certaine, that I beare now in my bodie (by the grace and mercie of God) the bleſſed markes of my Lord &amp; Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. Her Confeſſour hearing that, aſked her, how that might be, and how it had ben with her in all that tyme of her traunſe. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhe made anſwere and ſaid; Father, I ſawe our Lord faſtened vpon the Croſſe, comyng downe towardes me and enuironyng me rownd about with a meruelous beawtiful light. With the which gracious ſight my ſowle was ſo rauiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, and had ſuch a paſſing deſire to goe and meete with our Lord, that my bodie was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreined by the verie force of the ſpirite to ſet it ſelfe vp, as you might ſee. Then there came downe from the holes of his bleſſed woundes fiue bloodie beames, which were directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the ſame partes of my bodie, to witte, to my handes, feete, and hart. With that I cried out to our Lord and ſaid. O Lord, I beſeech thee,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:8350:105"/> let no ſinges of theſe holie markes appeere outwardly to the ſight of men. Sodainly, while I was ſpeaking theſe wordes, before thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ames were fully come downe to my bodie, they chaunged their coulour, out of a ſanguine red, into a meruelous brightnes and ſo in the fourme of a goodlie pure light they lighted and reſted vpon the ſaid partes of my bodie. When ſhe had thus declared her whole viſion, her ghoſtlie Father aſked her, whether anie of thoſes beames came downe to her right ſide or no. She anſwered, no, but only to her lefte ſide vpon the hart. He aſked her furthermore, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe felt anie ſenſible paine in thoſe partes, or no. With that ſhe fetched a great ſigh, and ſaid. Father, I ſuffer ſuch a great and ſenſible paine, in all thoſe fiue partes of my bodie, and ſpecially at my hart, that vnleſſe almightie God ſhewe a newe miracle, I can not long endure in this life. That word did her ghoſtlie Father take verie good head vnto, and he looked diligently, whether he might eſpie anie tokens of ſenſible paine in thoſe partes of her bodie. When ſhe had ſaid ſo much as ſhe would ſaie at that tyme, they went out of that chappell together towardes their lodging: and the holie maid betooke her ſelfe to her chamber and laie downe, and ſhewed ſuch euident tokens of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſickenes, that as manie, as were about her, thought certainely, that ſhe would haue dyed out of hand. Whereupon her Confeſſour,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:8350:105"/> with certaine other, that kept him companie, were called, to ſee that ſtrange caſe. When they came and ſawe her in ſuch extremitie, they were all ouercome with ſorrowe and heauines: for though they had ſeene her oftentymes before in verie weake caſe, yet had they neuer ſeene her ſo feeble, &amp; (to their ſeemyng) ſo neere to death. Neuertheles within a while after ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, and recouered ſo much ſtrength, that receiuing a litle meate, ſhe was able to ſpeak: and ſaid to hir ghoſtlie Father, as ſhe had ſaid before, that vnleſſe almightie God would by ſome newe miracle continue her life, ſhe had but a litle tyme to endure in this wordle. When her Confeſſour heard that, he called all her ſpirituall children together, both men and women, and beſought them with manie teares, that they would all with one voice offer vp their humble praier to God, beſeeching him, that he would vouchſafe to lend them their mother, that laie at the point of death, for a tyme, to directe and traine them yet further in the pathes of ſpiritual life. They aſſented all to his requeſt with a verie good will, and went with him to the chamber, where the holie maid laie in a traunſe. And do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> in the behalfe of them all, ſpake vnto her after this maner. Good mother, we knowe well, that your deſire is to be with your deere ſpowſe and Lord, our Sauiour Chriſt. But our deſire and earneſt ſute is, that you would take pitie on vs your poore children, and not leaue
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:8350:106"/> vs thus comfortles and without direction. Your reward is ſafely laied vp for you in heauen, and abideth your comyng. But we are in danger of periſhing a thouſand waies in this tempeſtuous ſea of the wordle. We knowe alſo, good mother, that your deere ſpowſe loueth you ſo tenderly, that he will denie you nothing, that you aſke him. Wherfore we beſeech you all with one voice, to make your humble praier to him, that he will vouchſafe to lend you yet a litle tyme of life emong vs, for our further inſtruction in this holie order of life, wherin you haue begun to trade vs. We will praie with you alſo: but what are we ſeelie wretches and ſinful creatures? we are vnworthie to appeere before his diuine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie, beinge, as we are, full of iniquitie and ſubiecte to manie imperfections. And therefore we praie you, deere mother, that our ſute maie be offred vp to almightie God by you: who for the tender loue, that you haue alwaies ſhewed to vs, are like to ſollicite it more carefully, and for the ſingular fauour, that you haue found in his ſight, are like to obteine it more certainly. Manie ſuch wordes ſpake her Confeſſour and the reſt to her with great heauines of hart, which they ſhewed more with the teares that they ſhed, then with the wordes that they ſpake. When they had ſaid, the holie maid made them anſwer after this maner. It is now long, as you knowe ſence I reſigned my ſelfe wholly vnto God, and haue no will of myne owne, but do remit all to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:8350:106"/> the direction of his bleſſed will. True it is, that I loue you verie entierly, and haue a great deſire of your ſaluation. And it is no leſſe true, that he loueth and tendreth you infinitly more, then I do or can do, and that he thirſteth after your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, more then I and all men are able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue: wherof we haue moſt ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, the ſhedding of his moſt precious blood. His will therfore be done in this and in all other thinges. I wil not ceaſe to praie for you, howbeit not otherwiſe, but only that his will be done: which (I knowe) ſhalbe beſt for you, howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it fall out. When ſhe had ſpoken theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, they went aſide fot a tyme in great heauines and perplexitie, vntill the tyme, that they might heare ſome more comfortable anſwere. The next daie after, ſhe called her Confeſſour vnto her, and ſaid; Father, I beleeue, our Lord hath ſomewhat condeſcended to your petition: and I hope, you ſhall vnderſtand his will and pleaſure touching the ſame within a ſhort tyme. And as ſhe ſaid, ſo it prooued in deed. For vpon the next morowe, which was ſondaie, ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the bleſſed Sacrament at her Confeſſours hand. And as on the ſondaie before ſhe was brought to verie great weakenes after the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the bleſſed Sacrament, ſo at this tyme ſhe was meruelouſly refresſhed and ſtrengthened in bodie. Which ſeemed ſtrange to as manie, as were there preſent. Then doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> ſeeing that wonderful and comfortable alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:8350:107"/> in her bodie, ſaid theſe wordes. I am now in great hope, that our Lord hath accepted our teares, and that he hath geuen fauorable eare to the humble praiers of vs his vnworthie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes. With that, for their further aſſurance and comfort, he aſked the holie maid, whether the paine, that ſhe was wont to haue in her handes, feete, and ſide, did continue ſtill, as it did before. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere and ſaid, that our Sauiour Chriſt had now ſo wrought in her bodie, that thoſe woundes or markes, were no more a griefe and torment vnto her, but rather a paſſing great ioye and ſenſible comfort: and that our Lord at their inſtance and ſute had graunted her a longer tyme of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this life, which ſhe was glad of, for the loue ſhe bare to them.</p>

                  <p>AT an other tyme the Apoſtle <hi>S.

Vpon <hi>S. Dominickes</hi> eueen a litle before euen ſong tyme, being in the Church occupied in praier, manie reuelations were ſhewed to her by <hi>S.

The which reuelations were ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to her, that ſhe was able at one tyme both to geue heed to them, and alſo to declare the ſame to others. While ſhe was thus occupied, it chaunced, that brother <hi>Barthelmewe</hi> her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours companion entred into the Church: in whom ſhe had as great affiance, as in her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour him ſelfe: for in her Confeſſours abſence, he was her ghoſtlie Father. When ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that he was come, ſhe aroſe and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, and ſaid that ſhe had to conferre with him concernyng certaine reuelations. Wherupon they ſate downe together in the Church, and ſhe began to declare to him manie ſtrange thinges, that our Lord had reuealed to

And ſhe (ſeeing by like the ſhadowe of his bodie, or els hearing the noiſe of his feete) caſt her eye a litle a ſide and beheld her brother, and ſo thought to returne to her foremer diſcourſe againe. But conſidering with her ſelfe, what ſhe had done, ſhe was toched at the hart with ſuch an inward grief for that litle diſtraction, that for a good tyme ſhe held her peace and ſpake not one word, but wept and wailed verie bitterly. At the length, the Friar that was there, ſeeing, that ſhe made no end of weeping, ſpake comfortable wordes vnto her, and praied her, that ſhe would goe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reward in her godlie talke. But ſhe ſo ſobbed and wept that ſhe was not able to geue him one word to anſwere. After a long ſpcae, when ſhe had wonne ſo much of her ſelfe, that ſhe was able to ſpeake, ſhe began with her ſelfe after this maner. Ah wretch, that thou art: thou ſhalt ſurely abide for it. With that Friar <hi>Barthelmewe</hi> aſked her, what offence that ſhould be, that ſhe tooke ſo heauiely? Out vpon me vile wretch, ſaid ſhe: ſawe you not, while our Lord was ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:8350:109"/> me his great myſteries and ſecrets, how I turned myne eye a ſide to behold a creature? Then the good man, who had great wonder to ſee the tendernes of her conſcience, and therfore deſired to excuſe or qualifie her offence, ſaid vnto her. Surrely mother, it ſeemeth verie ſtrange to me, that you ſhould make ſo great lamentation for a matter of ſo light impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for that turnyng aſide; for your eye en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured ſo litle tyme that (I aſſure you) I could not eſpie it. O father, ſaid ſhe, if you knewe, how ſharply our bleſſed Ladie rebuked me for that treſpas, vndoubtedly you would weepe and lament with me. When ſhe had ſaid thoſe wordes, ſhe held her peace, and would ſpeake no more of her reuelations, but continued ſorrowing and weeping for her offence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſuch tyme, as ſhe had made her Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and ſo with heauie cheere ſhe went home to her chamber. She declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to her ghoſtlie Father, that <hi>S.

And of that rebuke ſhe tooke occcaſion to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake to her ghoſtlie Father after this maner. O Father, ſaide ſhee, thinke you, what a confuſion, and ſhame that ſhalbee, that all wicked and vnhappie ſynners
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8350:110"/> ſhall abide at the later daie, when they ſhal ſtand before the maieſtie of God, ſeeing that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one only Apoſtle, is ſo dreadfull and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. I aſſure you, father, the apoſtles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des and contenance were ſo terrible to me, that, if I had not had comfort of a goodlie bright lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe, that ſtood by, while he ſpake to me, I thinke verily, my hart had neuer ben able to abide the ſame, but would haue dyed for verie ſorrowe, that it had of that extreme ſhame and confuſion. And thus it pleaſed God now and then to put her in mynd of her owne frailtie, eſpecially after ſuch great reuelations, which otherwiſe might haue moued her hart to pride.</p>

                  <p>THis holie virgin was now repleniſhed with ſuch aboundance of grace, that ſhe beſtowed in a maner the whole tyme of her life in heauenlie contemplations: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wherof, being often tymes rauiſhed in ſpirite and abſtracted from her bodilie ſenſes, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo feeble and fainte, that ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to keepe her bed. Where ſhe laie, as it were, in a continual longyng &amp; languiſhing after her ſpowſe: with the diuine loue of whome ſhe was ſo much inflamed, that ſhe might not well reaſon or thinke of anie other thing, but only of him. And manie tymes, by reaſon of the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie of that holie fyer burnyng in her hart, ſhe brake out into theſe wordes, and repeated the ſame againe and againe: O my moſt ſweet and louelie Lord, Sonne of God. O my moſt deere &amp; amiable ſpowſe, Sonne of the B. virgin Marie. With ſuch wordes did ſhe expreſſe the inward gronyng and melting of her hart. This was her mornyng and euenyng ſong: this her repaſt, when ſhe was hungrie: this her reſt after labour.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8350:113"/> In this tyme our Lord appeered vnto her often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes: which alſo increaſed the fyer in her hart: in ſo much that on a tyme being ouercome with the heate of the ſame, ſhe began (like one that were impatiently ſet to haue a thing) as it were to quarel and expoſtulate with him, ſaying. O my moſt ſweet and louely Lord, O deere ſpowſe of my ſoule, wherfore doſt thou ſuffer me to be holden here priſoner in the dongeon of this wicked worlde?

O my moſt gracious and amiable Lord, O moſt ſweet loue of my hart, ſuffer me no longer to dwell in this earthie and foule priſon, but take me out, and call me to dwell with thee in thyne euerlaſting tabernacles. To theſe wordes proceeding from ſuch a louing and languiſhing ſpirite, our Lord anſwered ſweetly after this ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner. Deere daughter, when I liued in earth, I
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8350:113"/> laboured to fulfill not myne owne will, but the will of my Father. And though I had an earneſt deſire to eate that laſt paſſeouer with my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples (as they heard me ſaie often tymes) and ſo to be with my Father: yet did I patiently abide the tyme, that my Father had ordeined. Thus much I tell thee, to inſtructe thee by myne owne example, that, though thou haue a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent deſire to be perfectly vnited to me in bleſſe, yet muſt thou tarry the tyme, that I haue appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

O Lord, ſeeing it is thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that I ſhall not yet paſſe out of this life, thy bleſſed will be done in all thinges, both in heauen and in earth. But yet one thing I moſt humbly beſeech thee, ſeeing it is ſo, that I maie not be vnited to thee in bleſſe, during the tyme of myne abode here in this life, graunt me thus much: that I maie be vnited to thee at the leaſt in thy paſſion, and that I maie haue a feeling of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie particular paine and torment, thou diddeſt ſuffer for me on the Croſſe, euen to the yealding vp of thy moſt holie ſpirite.

And being repleniſhed with knowledge, it foloweth likewiſe, that he ſawe moſt cleerely two pointes: the one, that almightie God was depriued of his honor, feare, and reuerence, that man owed vnto him: the other, that man was depriued of euerlaſting bleſſe, which was dewe to him for the ſaid ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, feare, and reuerence. And of this loue and knowledge, it muſt needes be, that he bare a meruelous heauie and continual Croſſe in his ſowle, which had euermore ſuch a great and vehement thirſt, to the honour of God, and to the ſaluation of man. And bicauſe he knewe, that the reſtitution both of the one and the other, to wite, both of the honour of God, and alſo of the ſaluation of man, was appointed by God to be wrought by the meane of his Croſſe: therfore he had euermore a meruelous great deſir to come vnto it: which deſire was vndoubtely a verie cordial and continual Croſſe vnto him, and neuer ended, vntill the tyme came, that his bodie was in deed ſtretched out and nailed vpon the tree of the Croſſe. She reaſoned yet further concerning that Croſſe of deſire, and ſaid thus. No man liuing is able to make a iuſt eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the paines and tormentes, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſuffred in his hart, by reaſon of the deſire, that he had, to paie the debt of mankind, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from the ſentence of death, and to
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:8350:115"/> bring them againe into the fauour of God. They only, that loue God with all their hart, with all their ſowle, with all their ſtrength, and their neighbour as them ſelues, maie gheſſe in ſome degree, what his paine was. Such good men maie, iudge in part by the loue that they haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to the honour of God and ſaluation of man, and by the griefe, that they feele in them ſelues, when the thing, that they loue, is either taken awaie or long delaied, what his griefe was. They maie iudge, I ſaie, in part, &amp; not perfectly: forſomuch as the loue, that man hath or can haue, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God and ſaluation of man, be it neuer ſo great, is nothging in compariſon of that paſſing great loue, that was in the hart of our Sauiour Chriſt. And therfore the deſire that he had to recouer both the one and the other, muſt needes cawſe in him a greater ſorrowe without all compariſon, then euer was or could be in man: vntill he ſawe an effectual and perfecte reſtitution made, to God of his honour and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: to man of his former ſtate of grace in this preſente life, and of glorie in the life to come. And thus much he ſignified to his diſciples, when he ſaid thoſe wordes: I haue had an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire to eate this paſſeouer with you: and afterwardes likewiſe, when in his praier to God the father he ſaid: Father, take awaie this cup from me. Which is as if he had ſaid in plaine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Father, I ſee here prepared for me a verie bitter cup of moſt ſharpe tormentes and death,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:8350:115"/> which I haue droncke continually in deſire euen from the hower of my conception, but now do begynne to drincke the ſame in deed, and ſo to make an end of drincking this paineful potion of the Croſſe: which I deſire thee to haſten and bring to an end. For that being once paſſed and gone, I ſhall reape the frute of my long and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire, to witte, I ſhall haue fulfilled myne obedience in all pointes to thee, reſtitution ſhalbe made perfectly, to God of his due honour, to man of his foremer ſtate. And I deſire not to haue this cup of my paſſion taken awaie, which thou haſt here made readie for me, which I take at thy fatherly hand like an obedient ſonne and drincke it willingly: but I deſire to haue that cup taken awaie from me and ended, which I haue droncke with ſuch an earneſt and greedie deſire ſo manie yeares for the loue that I beare to thyne honour, and to the ſaluation of mankind. This was the expoſition, that ſhe made vpon this place of the goſpel againſt the which, (bicauſe it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ſtraung and ſingular) her ghoſtlie Father doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> reaſoned after this maner. Mother, ſaid he, you knowe, that the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do commonly geue an other interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this place, almoſt contrarie to this, that you haue ſaid. They ſaie that our Lord deſired, in deed rather not to drincke that cup, then to drinke it: meanyng therby to declare to vs, that he was true man, and that, as true man, his fleſh did naturally abhorre death, as the fleſh of euerie
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:8350:116"/> man doth. And by this he would geue a doctrine, and withall an example in him ſelfe, to all wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke and fraile men, that they ſhould not be diſmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though they felt in them ſelues, that they did feare death. Forſomuch as the like feare &amp; frailtie was ſeene in our head alſo, who tooke vpon him all our infirmities, onlie ſynne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. To this the holie maid made anſwere thus. Father, ſaid ſhe, I knowe right well, that the holie doctours do expound this place, as you haue ſaid: and I find no fault with their expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And though this interpretation, that our Lord hath taught me, ſeeme diuerſe or almoſt contrarie (as you thinke) to that, yet is it verie true, and maie well ſtand with the common ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the holie Fathers; Father, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that our Sauiour Chriſt was head, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the weake and fraile, that feare and flee death, but alſo of the ſtrong and mightie, that beare it manfully, and yeald not to the feare and ſhrynking of the fleſh. And therfore he would in this acte and wordes, geue a doctrine and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to them both. He would tremble, and feare, and deſire that the bitter cup of his paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might paſſe awaie, to geue an example to the weake, that they might likewiſe feare and flee death without anie offence (if they had no commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie) He would alſo ouercome that feare and quaking of the fleſh by the force of reaſon and zeale of Gods honour, and deſire his Father to haſten that cup of his
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:8350:116"/> paſsion and death: to geue an example to the ſtrong that they ſhould not yeald to the frailtie, of the fleſh, and ſhrincke at the terrour of death, but folowe the direction of the ſpirite, and offer them ſelues valiantly to tormentes and to death it ſelfe, when by ſo doing, they might either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, or edifie their neighbour. And I ſee no cauſe, whie one place of the ſcripture ſhould not haue manie interpretations: forſomuch as the holie ſcripture (as you knowe) hath manie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and meanynges. Which the holie Ghoſt hath ſo ordained, that the holie ſcripture might ſerue diuerſe and ſundrie perſones, to diuerſe and ſundrie effectes. As we ſee this preſent text being diuerſely expounded, ſerueth men of diuerſe qualitie to verie good purpoſe: The weake for a refuge, if they retire and ſaue them ſelues: the ſtrong for a warrant, if they ſteppe forewardes, and offer them ſelues to euident danger for Gods ſake. Then, if you aſke me, how theſe two interpretations maie ſtand together, the one being contrarie to the other: (for by the one our Sauiour required, that the cup of his paſſion might be haſtened, by the other, that it might paſſe awaie) I anſwere, that I take it for none incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience, that in that agonie, he ſhould haue thoſe two contrarie effectes in him ſelfe, the one according to the fleſh, whoſe propertie it is, naturally to repine at anie thing that maie hurt: the other according to the ſpirite,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8350:117"/> which, looking to the honour of God and ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, deſired earneſtly the bitter cup of his death, by the drinking wherof he knewe right well, that both the one and the other ſhould be reſtored. When her Confeſſour had heard this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; diſcourſe, he replied no more, but held his peace, for in deed he was aſtoined, and knewe not, what to anſwere to the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and ſpirite of God, that ſpake in her.</p>

                  <p>BEing on a tyme rauiſhed in ſpirite, ſhe learned an other expoſition vpon this place of the goſpel, which her Confeſſour douctour <hi>Thomas</hi> commited to writing: and it was thus. Our Lord, ſaid ſhe, approching neere to his paſſion, ſet before the eyes of his mynd that great multitude of wicked men and women, which he ſawe, through malice and obſtinacie would not take the benefite of his death. The which ſight put him into ſuch an agonie, that he ſweat water and blood, &amp; for verie pitie, that he had of thoſe miſerable creatures, he was, as it we<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, enforced to vtter thoſe wordes; Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſſe from me. Which is as much, as if he had ſaid; Father, this cup, that is here preſented before me, is ſurely a verie bitter
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:8350:117"/> cup to me, ſeeing (as I do to my great griefe) the damnation of ſo manie ſoules, which without anie cauſe ſhall make light of this great loue, that I am here to ſhewe to mankind, and leeſe the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of my blood, which is now readie to be powred out for their ſake. Wherfore, if it be poſſible, I beſeech thee, that thou wilt pardon them, and in ſo doing take awaie this bitter cup from me. This, ſaid ſhe, was the praier, that our Sauiour made to his eternal Father. And ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded furthermore and ſaid, that he had without all doubt obteined the thing, that he demaunded, if he had requeſted the ſame abſolutely and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hout condicion: for what petition could he make to his Father, that ſhould not haue ben heard: who (as the Apoſtle ſaieth) was heard for the verie reuerence, that was in him ſelfe? But as on the one ſide the tender loue, that he bare to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, wonne ſo much of him, that he made that petition in their behalfe: ſo on the other ſide, the loue of Gods iuſtice moderated the vehemencie of his loue towardes mankind, and cawſed him to qualifie his earneſt demaund, with this clauſe and condicion: howbeit; O Father, not my will be done, but thyne. This holie maid declared yet further to her confeſſour and ſaid, that the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which our Sauiour ſuffred for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, were ſo exceſſiuely great, that it had ben impoſſible for anie man in this wordle to endure the ſame, but that he muſt needes haue dyed, if it had ben poſſible, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:8350:118"/> tymes. For as the loue, that he bare to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was vnſpeakeable and incomprehenſible: ſo were the paines, that he ſuffred for their loue, ſo great that no man had ben able to eſteeme them, and much leſſe to beare them. What man, ſaid ſhe, would haue beleeued, that thoſe thornes of his crowne, ſhould haue perſed thorough his ſcull into his braines? And yet ſo it was. Againe, who would haue thought, that the bones of a man ſhould haue ben drawen a ſonder and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiointed? And yet the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaieth: They told all my bones, ſpeaking of the vnmerciful and cruel tormentours, which haled and pulled him here &amp; there ſo violently, that they plucked his bones out of ioynt. Certaine it is, that the malice of thoſe wicked Iewes was verie great, and that they vſed him verie cruelly: and yet could not their malicious and cruel vſage haue done it, but only that his will was (to ſhewe his vnſpeakeable loue towardes vs) as it were vtterly to forſake him ſelfe, and to ſuffer his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to be deſtitute of all ſuch force and ſtrength, as might make anie reſiſtance againſt paines and tormentes. So that the principal cauſe of his paſſion was, the deſire, which he had, of ſhewing his loue to vs euidently and effectually. It was not the violent hand of thoſe tormentours, that were able to hold him (whome he made to fall downe at his foote with one woord of his mouth.) It was not the nailes, that were able to holde him faſt to the Croſſe: (which were his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:8350:118"/> creatures, and had no further power vpon their Creatour, but only ſo much as he would geue them:) but it was the loue, that he bare to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that tooke him: it was loue, that held him faſt: it was loue, that nailed him faſt to the Croſſe, and made him there to endure a moſt bitter and reprochful death. Such high wordes and ſentences did ſhe vtter to her confeſſour concernyng the paſſion of our Sauiour. And ſhe affirmed furthermore, that, whatſoeuer paines our Sauiour had borne in anie part of his bodie, the ſame had ſhe borne in her bodie alſo, in like maner as our Sauiour did, but not in like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure (for that had ben impoſſible for her bodie to beare) And to ſhewe, in deed, that ſhe knewe by exeperience, which of all thoſe paines was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, ſhe ſaid, that all the other paines were paſſed and gone, but one remained ſtill in her bodie, which was the diuulſion (as they terme it) or ſundering of the bones in the breſt: which paine was of all other paines (as ſhe ſaid) moſt grieuous. Now this paine of the breſt grewe on ſo vehemently vpon her, and withal the loue of our Sauiour, to whome ſhe was confourmed by ſuffring ſuch paines, increaſed ſo mightely in her hart, that ſhe was wholly ouercome with the force of the ſame, and her hart, like a thynne glaſſe filled with a verie ſtrong liqour, being not able to beare the ſtrength of that diuine loue,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:8350:119"/> braſt in ſunder (as ſhe declared afterwardes) and clefte in the middle from the higheſt to the loweſt part of the ſame. And certaine it is, that ſhe dyed in deed in the preſence of manie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and credible perſones, and ſo continued a long tyme. Of this matter ſhe made mention af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes in a letter writen to her ghoſtlie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her owne hand: in the which letter ſhe declared emong other thinges, how ſhe was taught by <hi>S.

                  <p>HEr ghoſtlie Father being deſirous to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arne the verie certainty of this matter at her owne mouth, on a tyme reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng with her, beſought her, that ſhe would tell him plainly, what had paſſed. She ſtood ſtill a great while, and could not geue him one word to anſwere for weeping: but at the length ſhe ſpake after this maner. O father ſaid ſhe, is it not a pitiful and lamentable caſe, that a ſoule, which hath ben once deliuered out of a darcke, priſon, and hath had the fruition of a moſt ioyous and beawtifull lighte, ſhoulde be conſtreined to forſake that goodly light, and to returne againe to dwell in his former darke and ſtinkinge don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon? O good Father, I am that wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:8350:119"/> vpon whom this calamitie is fallen by the ordinance of God for my ſinnes. How ſo ſaid he? Forſooth, ſaide ſhe, the fyre of Gods loue was at that time ſoe ſtronge in my harte, and the deſire which I had to be vnited to him, ſo vehement, that though my hart had ben of ſtone or of yron, it muſt needes haue broken in ſonder. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I geue you thus much to vnderſtand for certaine, that my hart was in deed vndone and opened from the vppermoſt part to the neither, only by the violence of that mightie loue: which, I beleeue, was of ſuch force, that no creature in this worlde had ben able to abide it: in ſo much that, me thinketh, I feele yet certai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne tokens of that clefte in my hart. And ſo often as it cometh to my mind, what a blesful ſtate my ſoule was in, in that meane tyme, while it was ſeparated from my bodie, I can not but weepe &amp; lament for my returne againe to this vale of miſerie. With that her Confeſſour praied her, that ſhe would make a declaration of the whole matter from the begynnyng. Wherunto ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de anſwere and ſaid. Father, after that I had ben fed and comforted a long tyme with diuerſe and ſundrie reuelations and viſions, which it pleaſed our Lord of his great mercie to ſhewe vnto me, at length for verie pure loue I fell ſo ſicke, that I was conſtreined to keepe my bed. Where lying, I made my humble petition to our Lord, that he would vouchſafe to deliuer me out of this wretched wordle and vnite me perfectly
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:8350:120"/> to him ſelfe. Which petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as then he would not heare. But yet he graunted me thus much, that I ſhould ſuffer, in the tyme of myne abode in this life, all the paines of his Croſſe and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: by the ſuffring wherof I ſhould both learne the better, how paſſing great his loue was towardes me, and alſo be ſtirred, by the example of his vnſpeakeable loue, in ſome degree to loue him againe. And ſo in deed it came to paſſe, that ſeeing (as it were) by an euident experience in my ſelfe, how great loue our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour bare to me, and how intolerable paines he ſuffred for my ſake, I was wholly ouercome with the force of ſuch ineſtimable kindnes, and my hart being not able to beare the ſtrength of ſo much loue, as it had conceiued, brake in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: by reaſon wherof my ſoule was alſo deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of this mortal bodie, and had the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his diuine maieſty (howbeit but for a litle tyme: which was my great griefe.) Then ſaid do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> to her. I praie you, good mother, tell me, how long was your ſoule out of your bodie? And what thinges did you ſee in that tyme? With that ſhe fetched a deepe ſigh, &amp; ſaid; Faher, thoſe that were about my bodie, &amp; made preparation for my burial, ſaid, that it was about a fower howers. In the which tyme I ſawe the diuine eſſence of almightie God: which cauſeth me now to liue with ſuch diſcontentation of mynd and miſliking of all thinges here in the worlde. And had it not ben for the zeale,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:8350:120"/> that I haue, to the honour of God, and edifying of myne euen Chriſtians, for whoſe ſakes my ſowle was reſtored againe to the bodie, without all doubt I muſt needes haue dyed for ſorrowe. And now the greateſt comfort, that I haue in the worlde, is, that I knowe and am well aſſured, that the more I ſuffer in this life, the more bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed I ſhalbe in the life to come. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all tribulations are to me, not vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and yrckeſome, but rather comfortable (as you ſee) and deliteful. I ſawe alſo the paines of the damned in hell, and of thoſe likewiſe, that are in purgatorie: which were ſo great, that no tongue of man is able to expreſſe them. I aſſure you Father, if wretched ſynners might ſee thoſe horrible paines and tormentes, they would rather chooſe to ſuffer an hundred deathes in this worlde (if it were poſſible) then to endure the leaſt paine, that is there, for the ſpace of one daie. But aboue others, I ſawe, that they were ſpecially puniſhed, which had broken their faith and promiſe geuen in matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, not keepinge them ſelues within the honeſt boundes and yoake of wedlocke, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the inordinate luſtes of their fleſh and ſenſualitie. Which was ſo ordained, not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the breach of weddelocke is the moſt heinous offence, that is there puniſhed (for there be manie greater ſynnes) but bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the offenders in this vice for the moſt
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:8350:121"/> part had neuer had anie remorſe of conſcience for this offence, as they had for the reſt of their ſynnes: and alſo bicauſe they had commonly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len more often into this ſynne, then to any other: for manie tymes a ſynne, which is in it ſelfe not ſo great, diſpleaſeth God highly, if it be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes committed, and no care had of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by contrition and penance. Now, when I had ſeene all theſe thinges, and had conceiued withal a moſt certaine hope, that, for myne owne part, I was paſſed all paines, and come to a ſtate of all ioye and gladnes, our Lord ſaid vnto me. Daughter, ſeeſt thou not theſe vnhappie ſynners and tranſgreſſours of my lawes, on the one ſide what ioyes they haue loſt, and on the other ſide what paines they haue found? for this cauſe haue I ſhewed theſe thinges to thee, bicauſe I will haue thee to returne againe into the worlde, to declare to my people their ſynnes and iniquities, and withal the great peril and paine, that hangeth ouer them, if they will not amend. When I heard, that I ſhould returne to the worlde againe, I was ſtriken with a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great feare and horrour. Wherupon our Lord, to comfort me againe, ſpake thus ſweetly vnto me. Daughter, there are a great nomber of ſowles in the worlde, which I will haue to be ſaued through thy meanes: and that is the cauſe, whie I ſend thee thither againe. Wherfore goe thy waie with a good will, and be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. From this tyme foreward my will is, that thou
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:8350:121"/> ſhalt change the order of thy life. Thou ſhalt no more keepe within thy cell, but goe abrode into the worlde to wynne ſowles. Thou ſhalt beare my name before al ſortes of men, high and lowe, clerkes and ſecular. I will bring thee before the bisſhops and head prelates in my Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fownd their pride. Be not afraid to conferre with them in high pointes concernyng the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſowles. For I will geue thee a wit to conceiue, and withal a mouth to ſpeake in ſuch ſort, that none ſhalbe able to withſtand thee. While our Lord ſpake theſe wordes to me, of a ſodaine my ſowle was reſtored to the bodie. The which when I perceiued, for verie ſorrowe I wept three daies and three nightes, and neuer ceaſed. And yet to this daie, I can not poſſibly abſteine from weeping, when it cometh to my mynd, how I was depriued of that paſſing great ioye and felicitie, and ſent backe againe to this darcke priſon of my bodie. Thus much I thought good to ſignifie to you, father, and to others alſo for this end, that when you vnderſtand, what a blesful ſtate of life, I haue forgon for a tyme (God knoweth howe long) and that I haue forgon the ſame by the ordinance of God, for the weale and edifyng of ſoules, you ſhould not meruaile here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, if you ſee, that I beare a great loue to them, who haue coſt me ſo deere, and that, to wynne them to God, I do alter the ſtate of my life, and conuerſe with them more familiarly, then I haue done hitherto. When doctour
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:8350:122"/> 
                     <hi>Raimundus</hi> had heard thus much, he gaue a great charge to as manie as were preſent of the brethren and ſiſters, that they ſhould in no wiſe vtter anie part of her talke, ſo long as ſhe liued. For being a wiſe man he ſawe, that wordlie perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes (ſuch as had not wholly and perfectly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected all their vnderſtandinge to the power of Chriſte) were like to take more harme by it, then good. And he ſawe then preſently by experience, that ſome of her owne ſcholers, which had before that tyme heard and folowed her doctrine, went backeward, bicauſe they were not able to apprehend the high myſteries, that ſhe vttered vnto them. But after her death, fearing leſt he ſhould haue offended God, if he had concealed ſuch great workes and wonders, he committed all to writing, for the benefite of the poſteritie. For further confirmation wherof, I thinke it not amiſſe, to towch briefely a verie notable thing, that it pleaſed our Lord to worke by her, while ſhe was ſo ſeperated from her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. At what tyme this holie maid drewe neere to her death, to the ſeemyng of ſuch as were about her, there reſorted vnto her diuerſe and ſundrie of her ſpiritual children, to ſee the maner of her paſſage: and with them manie deuout perſones, both men and women. By whome her Confeſſour doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> was alſo ſent for, to be preſent at her departure, and to helpe her (as the maner is) with the praiers and Sacramentes of holie Church. Who came ſpeedily, and three

When they ſawe, that ſhe had geuen vp the Ghoſt, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented all for the loſſe of their deere mother: but aboue the reſt one of the religious brethren, whoſe name was brother <hi>Iohn</hi> of Siena, ſorowed ſo much, and wept ſo vehemently, that he brake a vaine in his breſt; by reaſon wherof he coughed and auoided great gobbettes of blood. Which was an occaſion of double ſorowe to as manie, as were there: for both they lamented the dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſe of the holie virgin, which was alreadie gone, and alſo the peril of that good man, who with ſuch paine was not like to continue long after. Wherupon doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſour, being inwardly moued with compaſſion, ſaid to that ſicke Friar with a great faith and affiance in God.

There was preſent at all theſe doinges, beſides theſe afore named, one of her ſpiritual daughters called <hi>Alexa,</hi> who departed out of this wordle not long after.

                  <p>ON a tyme doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> making his abode in Siena, for certaine buſines, that he had there to doe, came one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to viſite the holie maid, and fownd her verie ſore pained with diuerſe and ſundrie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, but ſpecially with a great griping in the flanke commonly called <hi>Iliaca paſsio.</hi> All the which paine notwithſtanding, after certaine conference had betweene them concernyng the worthines and excellencie of the bleſſed Sacrament, ſhe beſought him, that ſhe might receiue that mornyng. Whervnto he aſſented with a good will, and ſo went to the Church to prepare him ſelfe to ſay maſſe. But her paines increaſed ſo vehemently vpon her, that ſhe ſent one of her ſiſters after him, to entreate him to tarrie a litle while, hoping after a tyme to haue ſome ſuch releaſe of her paines, that ſhe might be able to come to the Church. Where withal he was well contented, and abode her leiſure, till it was about noone. At what tyme ſhe fownd ſome eaſe, and came in deed to the Church to communicate. But before ſhe had ſignified ſo much to the father, certaine of the ſiſters, which ſawe that the tyme was farre ſpent, and knewe alſo, that her maner was after ſhe had receiued, to be rauiſhed in ſpirite and ſo to continue for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:8350:125"/> the ſpace of three, fower, or fiue houers, came to her and perſwaded with her, that ſhe ſhould abſteine from receiuing that daie, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the tyme was paſt, and that it would be a great trouble to the brethren, who muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo long to ſhut the Church doores, when all was done. Which counſel ſhe yealded vnto with great meekenes. But yet ſhe had ſuch an impatient deſire to receiue, that ſhe turned her ſelfe to our Lord after a ruthful maner, and ſaid. O my deere Lord and ſweete comfort of all afflicted hartes, ſeeing it hath pleaſed thee ſo graciouſly to put this deſire into my hart, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, that it maie alſo pleaſe thee to perfourme the ſame by thy ſelfe, which can not be perfourmed by men without their great trouble and diſquiet. Our Lord, who neuer deſpiſeth the deſire of a good hart, heard the inward gronyng of his hand maid, and gaue her comfort, that he would accompliſh her godlie requeſt not only merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, but alſo meruelouſly. Wherupon ſhe ſent one of her ſiſters to doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> to praie him to begynne maſſe at his pleaſure: for ſhe might not receiue at his hand that daie. With that he went to maſſe, ſuppoſing that ſhe had not ben in the Church, but at home in her chamber. And after ſacring, when the tyme was to breake the holie Hoſt: he thought to breake it (according to the maner and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:8350:126"/> of holie Chuch into three partes. But behold, contrarie to his meanyng and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſawe fower partes. Of the which, one part ſkipped from aboue the chalice, where he held it in his hand, and laid it ſelfe downe vpon the corporal, to his ſeeming. Where he beheld it aduiſedly, and afterwardes when he receiued, ſought for it diligently, and ſo did he likewiſe, when Maſſe was done, both on the corporal, and on the aulter, and al about beſide the aulter, and vpon the ground, but could neuer find it. Which put him in a great maze and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of conſcience. Wherupon he thought good to take the aduiſe of his priour: (who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a verie diſcrete and godlie man) and ſo in the meane tyme couered the aulter, and gaue a great charge to the Sacriſtane to ſee, that none ſhould come neere the aulter, til he came againe. Now, as he was going, in the way he met with the priour of the Carthuſians (his verie frinde and familiar) who came to conferre with the holie maid of certaine matters, and therfore praied him, that he would bring him to her ſpeech. I beſeech you, ſaid doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> haue a litle patience, while I goe and ſpeake two wordes with our Father priour, and I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne with all poſſible ſpeed, and bring you to her cell. Sir, ſaid he, I maie not tarrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this is (as you knowe) a ſolemne faſting daie with vs, and I muſt needes eate this daie with my brethren in the refectorie. The tyme is farre
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:8350:126"/> ſpent, (as you ſee) and I haue well nigh three miles home. Wherefore I muſt deſire you for Gods loue to diſpatch me, as ſoone as you can. For I am moued in conſcience to talke with her of certaine matters, when doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> heard that, for verie charitie he lefte his owne buſines vndone, and went with him towardes the holie maides chamber, ſuppoſing to haue fownd her there. But when he came thither and aſked for her: the ſiſters anſwered, that ſhe was gone to Church. To Church, ſaid he? when went ſhe to Church? for ſooth, ſaid they, before Maſſe: and there ſhe hath continued euer ſence. With that he was much aſtoined, and turned backe againe to the Church with the priour of the Carthuſians, where he fownd her in deed in a corner kneeling vpon her knees, rauiſhed in ſpirite (as her maner was to be) &amp; ſome other of the ſiſters with her. To whome he ſpake, and praied them, that they would vſe ſuch meanes as they might conueniently, to bring her to her ſelfe againe ſo ſoone as were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: For there was there with him a frind of his, that had a great deſire to ſpeake with her, and yet might not tarrie long. Now, when ſhe was come to her ſelfe againe, doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> tooke her aſide, and in fewe wordes opened his owne caſe to her: that he might geue place to his frind, whoſe vrgent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines required a more ſpeedie diſpatch. When ſhe hade ſaide, ſhe ſmyled on him after a
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:8350:127"/> comfortable maner, and aſked him, whether he had vſed ſuch diligence, as was requiſite, in ſeeking that peece. Wherunto he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he had ſought it with as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, as was poſſible. If you haue done ſo, ſaid ſhe, whie are you ſo careful? VVith that ſhe ſmyled againe, and went towardes the priour of the Charterhowſe, to ſpeake with him. In the meane tyme doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> remained ſomewhat comforted, but not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied: vntill he might knowe in deed, what was become of it. So ſoone as ſhe had done with the priour, and ſatisfied him in all ſuch demaundes, as he made vnto her: ſhe returned againe to doctour <hi>Raimundus:</hi> who, being verie deſiours to vnderſtand the truth of the matter, began with her after this ſort. Mother, ſaid he, it is you (I trowe) that hath taken awaie this peece of the holie Hoſt. No for ſooth, father, ſaid ſhe: it was not I, but an other that tooke it awaie from you, and therfore take no more care for it: for I aſſure you, you ſhall neuer find it. Then doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> praied her, that ſhe would declare to him the whole proceſſe of the matter: which ſhe did with a good will, to the honour of God, and to ſatisfie his careful mynd. Father, ſaid ſhe, be you no more careful for that peece of the bleſſed Hoſt. For I tell it to you, as to my ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie father, that it was brought to me, and I
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:8350:127"/> receiued it at the reuerend handes of our moſt bleſſed Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt. And, that you maie vnderſtand the cauſe alſo, I thinke it good to make yet a further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter vnto you. Father, it is ſo, that I was this mornyng in purpoſe, and had withal a verie earneſt deſire to receiue. But my ſiſters gaue me counſel to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: bicawſe my receiuing was like to be troubleſome to ſome of the brethren: who (as they ſaid) grutched ſomewhat at it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I thought with my ſelfe to folowe not myne owne will, but their aduiſe. But my deſire was ſo great, that, when I ſawe, that I could not receiue at the hands of men without their great trouble and diſquet: I turned my ſelfe to God, and beſought him in moſt humble wiſe, that he would vouchſafe to helpe his poore handmaid. Our gracious Lord heard my petition: and ſo foorthwith appeered vnto me, and miniſtred that fourth part, that you ſpeake of, to me with his owne handes. wherfore good Father, be you of good comfort, for you haue loſt nothing: and I haue fownd that wherby I remaine meruelouſly well refresſhed and ſatisfied. When doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> heard that, he was likewiſe fully ſatisfied: and ſo departed towardes his couent, praiſing and magnifying the infinite goodnes of almightie God, who filleth the hungrie with good thinges, and geueth the peace of
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8350:128"/> God, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, to them that ſerue him in holines and righteouſnes, and keepe them ſelues with a warie and fearefull regard from all ſuch thinges, as, they thinke, maie in anie degree offend his diuine maieſtie.</p>

                  <p>AS it was well knowen to diuerſe and ſundrie perſones, that this holie maid was meruelouſly vexed and put to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable paines by the malice of wicked ſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites: ſo it pleaſed God to ſhewe likewiſe to the wordle, that he had graunted her (as it were by ſpecial priuilege) authority &amp; iuriſdiction ouer the ſaid ſprites, to commaund, bynd, and caſt them out at her pleaſure, to the great comfort of the true and humble ſeruantes of God, and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:8350:130"/> withal to the vtter confuſion of thoſe proude ſprites, that ſet them ſelues vp againſt God and his ſeruantes: as maie appeere euidently by theſe examples here enſewing. There was in the citie of Siena a certaine notarie called maiſter <hi>Michael,</hi> who, when he was well ſtriken in yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, determined with the conſent of his wife, to forſake the wordle, and to geue him ſelfe to a more ſtreigth order of life. He determined alſo to dedicate two of his daughters to the ſeruice of God in a monaſterie founded in the name &amp; honour of S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> in the ſame citie. Where when they had continued a certaine tyme, one of the daughters, whoſe name was <hi>Laurentia</hi> (a child of eight yeares old) was by the ſecret iudgement of God poſeſſed with a wicked ſprit; by reaſon wherof the whole monaſterie was much diſquieted. Wherupon by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they ſent for her father, and gaue him his daughter againe. After that this child was thus taken out of the monaſterie, the wicked ſprite vttered many wonderful thinges by her mouth, and anſwered to manie darcke and hard queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And (which was moſt ſtrange) he ſpake commonly in the latine tongue. He diſcloſed alſo manie ſecret vices of diuerſe and ſundrie perſones, to their great reproach and ſlaunder. Which thing turned the father and mother, and others alſo of their kinred and acquentance to great heauines: who left no meane vnſought, wherby, they thought, they might eaſe the child.
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8350:131"/> Emong other thinges, wherin thoſe deuout fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes hoped in tyme to find helpe &amp; comfort, one ſpecial meane was the reliques of Sainctes kept in manie places in the citie: vnto the which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they reſorted daily with all diligence &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely to S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> tombe, (who had ben in his life tyme a Fryer preacher) to whome almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God had graunted a ſingular grace in caſting out deuels fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch as were poſſeſſed: in ſo much that his <hi>cope</hi> or <hi>ſcapular,</hi> which were there kept, being laied vpon them, that were vexed with vncleane ſprites, did verie commonly chaſe them awaie. Wherfore they brought the child thither and laied her downe vpon the tombe, &amp; caſt the ſaid clothes ouer her. And the father and mother in the meane tyme ſet them ſelues ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to praier, beſeeching our Lord with gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at inſtance, that it would pleaſe him, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of that holie Saincte, to take mercie on their child. But their praier was not heard as then. Which thing happened vnto them, not for anie ſynne, that they committed, but bicauſe it was otherwiſe diſpoſed by the prouident wiſdome of God: who (vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely) put it in the heartes of certaine of their frindes, to geue them counſel, that they ſhould repraire to the holie maid for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of their child. Which counſel they folo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in deed, and firſt ſent vnto her, praying her in moſt earneſt maner, that ſhe would vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to doe her beſt to helpe their daughter: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:8350:131"/> ſhe made anſwere, that ſhe had inough to doe with the wicked ſprites, that did from ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to tyme moleſt and trouble her ſelfe: and therfore praied them, that they would hold her excuſed. The parentes, whoſe hartes were verie heauie and careful for the innocent child, would not take that excuſe, but tooke their daughter, and went to her to her lodging; And came to the houſe ſo ſodainly, that ſhe could not poſſibly eſcape by the dore, but that they muſt needes haue a ſight of her. The which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſawe ſhe fownd the meanes to conueie her ſelfe out by a windowe, and ſo hid her ſelfe for that tyme in ſuch ſort, that they could not find her. At the laſt, when they had tried all waies, &amp; ſawe, that they could by no meanes come to her ſpeech (for ſhe had geuen charge to as manie, as were about her, that none ſhould moue her in that matter) they reſolued to goe to doct: <hi>Thomas</hi> her ghoſtlie father, &amp; to entreat him, that, ſeeing the caſe was ſo lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>table, &amp; ſhe ſo vnwilling to deale in it, he would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund her in the vertue of her obedience to keepe the child with her for a tyme. Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> was much moued with their pitiful ſute, and therfore put them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that he would doe for his part, what was poſſible to be done. But bicauſe he knewe well, that if he ſpake to her him ſelfe, ſhe would of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie make one excuſe or other in ſuch ſort, that he ſhould not be able to moue her anie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: he deuiſed this wyle. He awaited a tyme
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:8350:132"/> late in the euenyng, when he knewe, that the holie maid was abrode: &amp; then tooke the child, that was poſſeſſed, and put her into a chamber, whether he knewe, ſhe would come that night: leauing word with the reſt of the ſiſters, that they ſhould tell her, when ſhe came home, that he commaunded her in the vertue of her obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to ſuffer that child to remaine there with her all that night vntill the next morrowe. And ſo he went his waie, and lefte the child with them. Anon after, when ſhe came home and eſpied the child in her chamber, ſhe aſked the ſiſters, who had brought that child thither. They made her anſwere and ſaid, that doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her confeſſour had lefte the child there. And they declared furthermore, that he had willed her in the vertue of her obedience, to take the charge of the child till the next daie. When ſhe heard that, ſhe made no more a doe: but ſet her ſelfe foorthwith to praier, and cauſed the child to kneele downe and praie with her. And ſo they continued together all that night, encountering and fighting againſt the wicked ſprite, vntill at the length a litle before daie he was conſtreined by the force of her faithful praier to depart, and to leaue the innocent child without doing anie harme to her bodie. The which thing when one of the ſiſters caled <hi>Alexia</hi> perceiued, ſhe ranne to doctour <hi>Thomas,</hi> and told him, that the child was deliuered. Doct: <hi>Thomas</hi> likewiſe being very glad of that ioiful newes, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the father &amp; mother;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:8350:132"/> and brought them with him to the holie maides chamber. Where, when they ſawe the child deliuered in deed, they wept for ioye, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied almightie God, that had geuen ſuch power to his humble ſpowſe. But the holie maid knewe, that the wicked ſprite had not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the child: and therefore intreated the father and mother, that ſhe might remaine there with her a litle tyme, which they graunted with a good will. Then ſhe began to inſtructe the child, &amp; exhorted her to geue her ſelf to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual prayer. And withal ſhe gaue her a great charge, that ſhe ſhould in no wiſe depart out of the houſe, vntill her father and mother came thether againe to fetch her home. Which poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes the child obſerued verie well. Now it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in this meane tyme, that the holie maid had occaſion to goe home to her owne houſe about ſome neceſſarie buſines: (for all this was done, not in her owne houſe, but in the houſe of one of the ſiſters called <hi>Alexia:</hi> of whome mention is made before) and there to continue all that daie: for the which tyme ſhe lefte the child with a ſeruant, &amp; gaue her a great charge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. When ſhe had paſſed ouer the whole daie in her owne houſe about ſuch neceſſarie buſineſſes, as ſhe had there to doe, and night was come: ſhe willed <hi>Alexia</hi> to giue her her ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tel: for ſhe would returne with her to her houſe. To that <hi>Alexia</hi> made anſwere and ſaid, that it was verie late, and that it would be euel thought of, if women (eſp
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:8350:133"/> religious perſones) ſhould be ſeene abrode at that tyme of the night. O <hi>Alexia,</hi> ſaid ſhe; we muſt needes goe, for that helliſh wolfe is about to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke my litle lambe awaie from me againe. And with that they went both together, and found the child in deed verie ſtrangely altered, her face all red, and her wittes vtterly diſtracted. When the holy maid ſawe that, ſhe brak out with great indignation, into theſe wordes. Ah thou foule feend of hell, how durſt thou thus to enter agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vpon this poore innocent? I truſt in the great goodnes of my deere Lord and Sauiour, that thou ſhalt now be caſt out in ſuch ſort, that thou ſhalt neuer dare to enter againe. And with that ſhe tooke the child with her into her chamber, where ſhe continued for a certaine tyme in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Which done, ſhe brought out the child agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne fully deliuered of that wicked ſprite: and willed that other ſiſter, that was there with her, to take the child and laie her downe vpon the bed, that ſhe might reſt a while. And the next morrowe ſhe ſent for the father and mother: to whome ſhe ſpake after this maner. Take your child home with you on Gods name, for from this daie foreward ſhe ſhall neuer be troubled more with that wicked ſprite. They tooke their child with glad hartes, and lead her to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie from whence ſhe came: where ſhe liued a verie bleſſed life vnder that holie rule and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and was neuer moleſted more to her dying daie. Which thing was ſo ioyous to maiſter <hi>Michael</hi> her father, that he could neuer
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:8350:133"/> tell it afterwardes, but that he wept for ioye. And he honoured the holie maid in his hart, as if ſhe had ben an Angel of God. Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> being certified of this great miracle by the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful report of doctour <hi>Thomas, Alexia,</hi> and of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother of the child, went him ſelfe to the holie maid, and deſired her, that ſhe would enforme him particularly of the matter. But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially he was deſirous to knowe the cauſe, whie the thing was not wrought by the vertue of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me holie reliques (which the father and mother ſought ſo diligentlie vnto) or els exorciſmes, as it is wont to be. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere, that it was a verie rough and ſtubborne ſprite, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatly bent, that at the firſt tyme ſhe was faine to continue in battaile againſt him from the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng til the fourth houer of the night, before ſhe could expell him; And at the length, when he ſawe, that he muſt needes depart; (being indeed therunto conſtreined by the force of her feruent praier, and by vertue of the charge that ſhe gaue him in Gods be halfe) he ſaid theſe wordes to her. If I muſt needes depart out of this child, I will enter into thee Wherunto ſhe made anſwere &amp; ſaid; If it be Gods pleaſure (without whoſe lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce I am well aſſured, thou maieſt doe nothing) our Lord forbid, that I ſhould be againſt his holie will in anie thing. The which wordes, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a verie humble and and reſigned ſpirite, ſo ſtrooke the proud feend, that he loſt all the ſtrenght, that he had before againſt the innocent child.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:8350:134"/> Howbeit in paſſing out, he reſted a while in the chides throte: which was perceiued by a great ſwelling, that he made in that place. Which thing the holie maid ſeeing, ſhe made the ſigne of the Croſſe ouer the childes throte: by vertue wherof the wicked ſprite was vtterly diſpoſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſuch ſort, that he might neuer returne, to diſquiet the child againe.</p>

                  <p>ON a tyme, while this holie maid was at a certaine caſtel or towne called Rocka within the territorie of Siena, with a worſhipful ladie, whoſe name was Madam <hi>Bian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>china,</hi> it happened, that a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſame caſtel was ſodainly taken and miſerably tormented with a wicked ſprite. The which piteful ſight when Madame <hi>Bianchina</hi> ſawe, ſhe was ſo moued with compaſſion, that ſhe thought to become an earneſt ſuter to the holie maid for her deliuerie. But, bicauſe ſhe vnderſtood, that ſuch ſutes were commonly verie vnpleaſant to the holie maid (who of a great humilitie ſhewed her ſelfe euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more verie loth to meddle in anie ſuch matter) ſhe aſked counſel of certaine of the religious ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that were there with the holie maid: whoſe aduiſe was, that the woman ſhould be brought to her preſence ſodainly and vnawares to her: that the ſight of the piteful creature might moue her to compaſſion. The which aduiſe ſeemed
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:8350:134"/> verie good, and according to the ſame the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was in deed on a daie brought in before the holie maid, in a place, where ſhe happened to be, making a loue-daie betweene two, that were fallen out. When ſhe ſawe the wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and ſawe withal, that ſhe could by no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes auoid: ſhe turned to the ladie <hi>Bianchina,</hi> and ſaid. Ah madame, God forgeue you. Wote you, what you haue done? knowe you not, that I haue trouble inough by theſe wicked ſprites, that doe from tyme to tyme moleſt myne owne perſone? wherfore then doe you increaſe my trouble, in preſenting others before me, that are vexed with theſe foule feendes? With that ſhe turned to the woman, that was poſſeſſed, and ſaid to the wicked ſprite. Thou malicious enemie of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, I charge thee, laie downe thy head here in this mans lappe, and abide there, till I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. She had no ſooner ſpoken thoſe wordes, but that the woman, that was vexed, laid downe her head in a certaine Anchorites lappe, that was there by, who was called <hi>Sanctus,</hi> and neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued till ſhe came againe. In this meane tyme, while the holie maid was gone out, to make vp a full peace betweene two men of warre, that were at variance (whoſe dwelling was not farre from that place:) the ſprite cried out mightely by the mouth of that miſerable woman, leanyng her head in the Anchorites lappe, and ſaid. Whie doe ye hold me here? I praie you, let me goe for, I am verie hard houlden. They that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8350:135"/> ſtood thereby, made anſwere, and ſaid to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And whie doſt thou not goe thy waie? who holdeth thee? Is not the doore open? Oh, ſaid he, that curſed woman hath bound me here. She holdeth me, that I maie not depart. What woman, ſaid they? That, that curſed woman, ſaid he: and would not, or peraduenture could not name her: but after a raging maner cried out, that curſed creature, that curſed woman, myne enemie. Then the Anchorite aſked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he tooke her for his great enemie, or no. Yea, ſaid he, the greateſt, that I haue this daie in the wordle. Then thoſe that were there preſent, being much diſquieted with his outragious cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid to him. Hold thy peace, Caterine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: (meanyng therby to put him in feare, and ſo to cauſe him to ceaſe his crying.) No, no, ſaid he, ſhe cometh not yet. She is in ſuch a place (where ſhe was in deed) They aſked him, what ſhe did there: what doth ſhe, ſaid he? She is now doing of a thing (as ſhe is at all tymes) wherin I take ſmall pleaſure. And with that he cried out againe verie ſore, and ſaid. Ah, whie am I thus holden here? And it was euidently ſeene, that he neuer moued from that place, where the holie maid charged him to abide, till her comyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. At the laſt he ſaid, Now is that, that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed woman comyng. They demaunded of him where ſhe was. She is now, ſaid he, in ſuch a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:8350:135"/> tyme to tyme, how ſhe paſſed from place to place vntill at the length, when ſhe was come to the gate of the houſe, where they were, he ſaid. Now ſhe is come. When ſhe was entred into the houſe and began to make towardes the chamber, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin they abode her returne: he cried out with a lowd voice, &amp; ſaid. Ah, why hold yee me here by force? The holie maid made anſwere, and ſaid; Ariſe wretch, and get thee hence, and leaue this creature of God: and from this houer foreward ſee that thou be neuer ſo hardie, as once to moleſt her againe. And with that it was ſeene, that the wiked feend forſooke all the other partes of that womans bodie, and gathered him ſelfe into her throte: where he made ſuch an horible ſwelling, that it moued as manie as were preſent, to great compaſſion. Then the holie maid made the ſigne of the Croſſe ouer the place that was ſwolen, and forthwith he went his waie &amp; lefte the woman ſafe and ſound, in the preſence of a great manie, that were there, and ſawe this euident miracle with their eyes. But bicauſe the poore woman had ben ſore trauailed by the feend, the holie maid willed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring her home to her howſe, that ſhe might reſt a while &amp; take ſome ſuſtena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce And ſo they did.

They made her anſwere, and declared vnto her, in what

When ſhe heard that, ſhe was aſtoined: and ſaid, that in truth ſhe could remember no ſuch thing. Only this ſhe confeſſed, that her bodie was verie ſore ſhaken and bruſed, as if it had ben beaten with a cluble. Then ſhe turned her ſelfe after a verie humble maner towardes the holie maid, and with moſt hartie thankes acknowledged the great benefite, that ſhe had there receiued at Gods hand through her meanes. Of this euident miracle were witneſſes, the ladie <hi>Bianchina,</hi> that holie Anchorite, in whoſe lappe it was done, &amp; other moe, to the number of thirtie perſones.

But afterwardes in the tyme of Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the ſixte, when he ſawe and felt alſo that wicked rebellion, that was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt him by the proude prelates of the Church: he called to mynd, what the holie maid had ſaid vnto him before: and thought euerie hower a daie, vntill he might haue ſome opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie to conferre with her concerning the ſtate of thoſe preſent troubles. Which by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of almightie God came to paſſe, euen as he deſired; for in that furie of rebellion and ſchiſme the holie maid was ſent for to Rome, by commaundement of the Popes holines: where Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> repaired vnto her, and put her in mynd of ſuch communication, as had
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:8350:138"/> paſſed betweene them long tyme before in Piſa. I remember well, ſaid ſhe, that ſuch wordes I ſpake to you at that tyme: which now you ſee verified. And now I will geue you to vnderſtand thus much more. Like as I ſaid to you then, that the rebellion of that tyme was but mylke and honey in compariſon of this, that you ſee now: euen ſo I tell you now, that theſe preſent trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are but a childes game, in compariſon of thoſe horrible calamities, that are to come. And with that ſhe began to recite diuerſe and ſundrie plagues, which, ſhe foreſawe, ſhould fall vpon manie partes of the wordle, and namely vpon the Kingdome of Sicilia and countreis there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. The which prophecie was in deed fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſoone after in the tyme of Queene <hi>Ione</hi> and of her ſucceſſour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with ſuch vnwonted ſcourges, calamities, and almoſt vtter ſubuerſion, not only of the Kingdome of Sicilia, but alſo of all other Kingdomes, Territories, and Cities, lying neere vnto it, that Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> and as manie as liued and ſawe afterwardes the horrible ſtate of that bloodie tyme, confeſſed, that the like had not ben often ſeene in thoſe partes of the wordle before. When Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> had heard thus much concerning the ſcourges and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that were towardes the Church (of the which, ſome he ſawe then preſently verified, and therefore doubted nothing of the reſt) he asked the holie maid, whether after all theſe ſtormes there were not like to come a calme emong the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:8350:138"/> people of God. Wherunto ſhe made anſwere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this maner. Father, ſaid ſhe, almightie God hath determined thus to purge his Church by calamities and tribulations. The which when he hath once done, he will raiſe vp a newe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite in his choſen ſeruantes, and ſend ſuch go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlye Paſtors and Curates ouer his flocke, that my hart reioyſeth within my bodie to thinke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that goodlye reformation, that ſhall inſue in all ſtates of men. And as the Church of Chriſt ſeemeth now poore, deformed, and naked; ſo ſhall it then be ſeene in a verie glorious and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull ſtate, clad with the ſeemelie ornamentes of vertue &amp; godlines. The good ſhall ioye to ſee the Church of God in ſuch a flouriſhing peace: and the euel ſhalbe allured, by the ſweet ſauour of their vertuous conuerſation, to folowe them in the patthes of Gods holie commandementes. Therefore, father, thanke our Lord, who of his gracious goodnes voutchſafeth, after raine and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſtes to ſend faire wether. Thus much ſpake the holie maid touching the ſtate of the Church to Doctour <hi>Raimundus;</hi> whom ſhe lefte in a great perplexitie betweene ſorrowe and ioye: verie ſorrowfull, in conſideration of the great ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that he ſawe, were to come vpon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: and contrariwiſe verie ioyful, in regard of that great good, which, he was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſured, ſhould inſue of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>AS this holie maid, being directed by the infallible light of Gods holie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, entred into the innermoſt cloſet of his Diuine prouidence, and there ſawe, what order was taken for thinges to come in the worlde: ſo likewiſe she was able by the direction of the ſame light, to enter into the moſt ſecret corners of mens hartes, and there to take a vewe of their hidden thoughtes and deſigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. Wherof Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> gaue a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full teſtimonie in him ſelfe, ſaying and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly affirming, that on a tyme, while he was in companie with the holie maid, his mynd was occupied about certaine thoughtes, that were vnpleaſant to God. Which thing she percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, gaue him warning, that he should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe his mynd from ſuch thoughtes, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie him ſelfe about ſome other matters. He (as a man) began to excuſe him ſelfe with a lie, and ſaid, that he had no ſuch thing in his mynd. O good Father (ſaid she after a verie humble maner) wherefore ſaie you ſo? Will you denie me that, which I ſee more cleerely, then you ſee it your ſelfe? And with that she tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion both to tell him preciſely, what he thought
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:8350:139"/> at that tyme, and withal to geue him a good leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how he should auoid the like thoughtes an other tyme. Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> confeſſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to the glorie of God, (though in deed it founded in ſome degree to his owne reproch in the wordle) that the like happened betweene them at diuerſe and ſundrie tymes. There was alſo in the citie of Siena a worſhipful knight called Sir <hi>Nicolas Sauacines,</hi> a man of great valour in his daies and welbeloued of all men. When this Sir <hi>Nicolas</hi> had ſpent a great part of his life abrode in the warres of foraine contreis, at the length in his age he returned home to his owne contrey and houſe: where he liued rechleſly in paſtimes and pleaſures, deceiuing him ſelfe (as the maner of ſuch men is) with this falſe ground, that he should haue tyme inough to doe penance before his end. His wife and frindes, being ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous folkes them ſelues, and therefore ſorie to ſee him in ſuch caſe, perſwaded with him ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, that he would goe to Confeſsion, and doe penance for his foremer life. But whatſoeuer they ſaid to him in that behalfe, he gaue but a deaffe eare to their wordes. Then it came into their mynd (vndoubtedly by the ſecret inſtincte of almightie God, who deſireth not the death of a ſynner, but rather that he be turned and liue) that they ſhould moue him to goe to the holie maide, whoſe name was at that tyme verie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe ouer all the citie for manie vertues, and namely for a ſingular grace, that ſhe had, in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:8350:140"/> with thoſe men, that were hard harted and obſtinately ſet to continue in their ſynful ſtate of life. And ſo with this mynd they went to him, and exhorted him verie effectually, that he would now in his later daies looke more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ully to his ſoules health, and in regard of that hey gaue him counſel, that he ſhould reſort at his conuenient leiſure to the holie maid, and talke with her: and they doubted not, but that her good talke and praiers ſhould doe him much good. When the knight heard them name the holie maid: tuſh, ſaid he, thinke you, that I haue nothing els to doe, but to goe &amp; talke with her? What good is ſhe able to doe me? Then his wife (who was a good vertuous woman and well acqueinted with the holie maid) went to her, and with great lamentation opened to her, what had ben done by her ſelfe and by her frindes for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion of her husband: whoſe heart not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding was ſo hardened, that they could doe him no good. And therefore ſhe beſought the holie maid to praie to God for her husband: that his hart might be mollified &amp; made apte to receiue the grace of God. The holie maid promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ladie, that ſhe would haue her husband in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance: and ſo ſhe had. Soone after, the holie maid appeered to the knight in his ſleepe, &amp; gaue him warning, that, if he mynded to eſcape euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation, he ſhould geue eare to his wiues counſel touching his ſoules health. So ſoone as he was awaked, he told his wife, what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:8350:140"/> in his ſleepe: and he told her furthermore, that he would goe &amp; talke with the holie maid, to knowe, whether it were ſhe, that had ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peered to him, or no. His wife was verie glad of that, and went to the holie maid before, to thanke her for her charitie, and to entreat her, that ſhe would appoint a tyme and place, where her husband might come and ſpeake with her. Which ſhe did with a good will: and he came, &amp; was by her good exhortations ſo thoroughly turned in hart, that he promiſed to goe out of hand to Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her ghoſtlie Father, and to him to confeſſe his ſynnes. And ſo he did. Now, when he had done, he came to her againe in the Church, where she was, and told her, that he had confeſſed his ſynnes, and taken pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the ſame. Sir, ſaid she, you haue done verie well: and shall by the grace of God doe better hereafter. But I praie you, tell me. Haue you confeſſed all your ſynnes? Yea, ſaid he, all that came to my mynd. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non after she asked him againe, whether he had made a full and perfecte confeſsion of all his ſynnes. And euer he made anſwere, that he had done it. At the length, she willed him to examine his conſcience with good diligence, and to thinke aduiſedly, whether he had not lefte out ſome ſynne, that was committed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie yeares before. And ſtill he ſaid, that to his remembrance he had lefte no one ſynne vnconfeſſed. With that she tooke him a ſide,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:8350:141"/> and put him in mynd of a verie grieuous ſynne, which he had committed manie yeares before in Apulia: which ſynne was alſo ſo ſecretly done, that she could neuer haue come to the knowledge of it, vnleſſe it had ben reueled vnto her by God. When the knight heard that, he was meruelouſly aſtonied: and acknowledging him ſelfe in deed gyltie, he went without anie longer delaie to her ghoſtlie father, and made his confeſsion of that ſynne particularly. And from that daie forewarde he bare ſuch a reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and loue to the holie maid, that he could neuer ſpeake inough of her vertue and holines. In ſo much that he would ſaie of her, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Samaria ſaid of our Sauiour Chriſt. Come and ſee a holie virgin, that hath told me all that I haue done. Is not she (thinke you) a great prophetiſſe? This knight, after that he was thus turned by the holie maid, liued euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more in awe of her, euen as a child doth of his maiſter, and was wholly directed by her in all thinges vntill his dying daie (which was within one yeare after.)

When Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> perceiued (partly by their ſuſpicious maner, and partly by ſome wordes, that they caſt out) what their

On a tyme, while the holie maid was talking with Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> concerning the ſtate of the Church (where Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> was vſed for an interpretour betweene them: becauſe the Pope vnderſtood not the Italian tongue, and ſhe ſpake no latine) emong other thinges ſhe lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted her verie much of the court of Rome, and ſaid, that where of reaſon there ought to be a moſt pleaſant paradyſe of vertue and holines, there ſhe found a moſt lothſome ſyncke of all ſtincking vice and vncleannes. The Pope, being ſomewhat moued with thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, asked of Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> how long it was, ſence ſhe was firſt acqueinted with the court of Rome. And vnderſtanding, that it was but a fewe daies, he asked her, how ſhe came to haue ſuch knowledge of the maners of the court in ſo fewe daies. With that she raiſed her ſelfe vp with a certaine comelie boldnes (whereas before she held downe her head) and ſaid theſe wordes to the Pope. To the honour of almightie God I dare well ſaie thus much, that I had a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:8350:145"/> more perfecte ſent of the horrible ſtench of the ſynnes, that are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted in the court of Rome, when I liued at home in myne owne countrey, where I was borne, then they haue them ſelues, that doe commit ſuch ſynnes euerie daie. When the Pope heard theſe wordes, he held his peace, and wondred much at the ſtrangenes of her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. But Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> aboue all other was meruelouſly aſtonied, ſeeing her to ſpeake in the preſence of ſo great a Prelate, as that Pope was, with ſuch an vnwonted boldnes and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. It happened often tymes (as Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> and diuerſe other credible perſones re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported) that when she came with them into places, where neither she nor they had euer ben before, there reſorted vnto her manie men and women, that ſeemed by their apparel, wordes, and outward behauiour, verie honeſt and godlie folkes: but were in deed geuen to ſome vncleane vice. Which thing she perceiued by and by, and therefore would in no wiſe be brought to ſpeake with them of heauenlie matters (as they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) nor ſo much as to turne her face towardes them. And if she ſawe, that they taried ouer long, she would breake out into wordes alſo, and ſaie to them, that, if they mynded to talke of God or of godlie matters, they should firſt ridde them ſelues out of the deuels ſnares and amend their liues. And with that she would find ſome occaſion to withdrawe her ſelfe from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie. Now her Confeſſour and other, that were
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:8350:146"/> about her at ſuch tymes, enquiring further of the behauiour and conuerſation of ſuch perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as ſhe refuſed thus to ſpeake withal, found in deed, that they were noted of ſome grieuous crime, and that they continued in the ſame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance. An other tyme there came a woman to ſpeake with the holie maid, whoſe behauiour was ſo woman lie and talke ſo honeſt, that, ſo manie as were there preſent, tooke her to be a verie vertuous woman. The which notwithſtanding, the holie maid turned her face awaie from her (as it ſeemed) of purpoſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe she would neither ſee the woman, nor be ſeene of her. Whereof Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> had great wonder, and therefore tooke occaſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes to aske her ſecretly, what the cauſe was, whie she had ſo done. To whom she made anſwere after this maner. O Father, ſaid she, if you had felt ſuch a ſtench of ſynne, as I felt, while that woman ſpake to me, I am well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, you would haue caſt vp all, that had ben in your ſtomake.

                  <head>Chap. 7.</head>
                  <p>AT what tyme Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the ſixt was enforced to flee out of Rome, by reaſon of a rebellion, that was raiſed againſt him in the citie by the french faction: the holie maid, which as then was left behind in Rome, and ſawe the miſerable ſtate of the Church, wept daie and night, and with continual ſighes and ſobbes made her praier to our Lord, beſeeching him moſt inſtantly that he would voutchſafe to ceaſe the furie of thoſe wicked rebels, and geue peace to his afflicted Church. And it was well ſeene, that her praier was heard. For ſoone after it pleaſed God ſo to diſpoſe, that in one daie both thoſe factious ſchiſmatikes that had taken armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sea Apoſtolike, were vanquished and taken, and the caſtle of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> which had holden out long tyme before, rendred it ſelfe into the Popes handes. When our holie father the Pope vnderſtood of this great victorie, he returned to the citie againe: where he asked the holie maid her aduiſe, what she thought beſt to be done in that caſe. And her aduiſe was, that he should goe bare footed to S. <hi>Peeters</hi> Church, and all the people with him, to thanke God with all
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:8350:147"/> ſubmiſsion and ſowlines of hart, for that ioyous calme after ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſtormes. And thus the Church of Chriſt began (as it were) to reuiue againe: and the holie maid tooke paſsing great comfort to ſee it. But that ioye endured not long. For within a litle tyme, after theſe troubles were pacified, the deuel, whoſe malice is euermore vigilant againſt the Church of God, raiſed vp a newe tempeſt. And what he could not bring to paſſe by the furie of ſtrangers, that did he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt againe by ſowing diſcord betweene the citizens of Rome and the Popes holines. When the holie maid perceiued that, and ſawe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent peril, that was like thereby to enſue to the Church of God, she turned her ſelfe to our Lord in praier, and beſought him, that he would hold his holie hand ouer the people, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to commit ſuch a wicked and heinous ſynne. And as she was thus praying, she ſawe the citie full of damned ſprites, ſtirring and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing the people to kill the Pope; And thoſe ſprites cried horribly to her, and ſaid. Thou cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed wretch, thou art euermore buſie to let our deſignementes. But be thou well aſſured, we shall put thee to a foule death. She gaue them no word to anſwere, but continued her praier with greater feruour and deuotion, beſeeching our Lord with all inſtancie, that he would voutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to keepe her from all miſchiefe, and alſo that it would pleaſe him to preſerue the Pope, his lieuetenant and vicar general in earth, from all
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:8350:147"/> the violent attemptes of thoſe wicked conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, for the honour of his owne holie name, and for the redreſſe of his deere Spouſe the Church, which as then was in verie lamentable ſtate. She praied likewiſe for thoſe impious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, and beſought our Lord moſt earneſtly, that he would voutchſafe of his infinite mercie to mollifie their hartes, &amp; not ſuffer them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſuch a horrible ſinne, as to murder their owne Father and Paſtour. When she had praied often after this maner, it pleaſed God one tyme to geue her this anſwere. Daughter, ſaid he, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the people to acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plish their malice, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting this damnable ſynne, that they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: that I maie exerciſe my iuſtice, and punish them according to their deſertes. For their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes is ſo odious and horrible in my ſight, that it maie no longer be endured. When the holie maid heard thoſe dreadful wordes, she ſet her ſelfe to praier againe, with farre greater deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vehemencie of ſpirite then before, and ſaid. O moſt merciful Lord, thou ſeeſt, how thy deere of Spouſe the Church, whom thou haſt redeemed with the price of thy moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood, is this daie miſerably vexed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted almoſt through out the wordle. Thou knoweſt on the one ſide how fewe there are, that shewe them ſelues readie to aſsiſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her; and thou art not ignorant on the other ſide, how manie there are and how cruelly bent, that ſeeke by all poſsible meanes to annoye and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:8350:148"/> diſcomfort her. And in this behalfe it can not be hidden from thyne eyes, which ſee all thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, how manie treacheries and treaſons there are now in contriuing, to make our holie father thy vicar out of the waie. The which moſt deteſtable conſpiracie, if it take place, muſt nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des turne not only this citie of Rome, but alſo the whole bodie of Chriſtendome to great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort and ſlaunder. Therefore, ô bleſſed Lord, I moſt humbly beſeech thee, that thou wilt for this tyme temper the rigour of thy iuſtice, and ſpare thy people, whom thou haſt bought ſo deere. After this maner did the holie maid continue manie daies and manie nightes together in feruent praier: in the which tyme our Lord did euer more alleadge iuſtice, and ſhe craued mercie. And all the tyme, that ſhe was thus occupied in praier, the wicked ſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes did ſo vexe and torment her with their horrible ſcriching and crying, that her bodie waxed meruelous feeble. In ſo much that, if our Lord had not by his almightie power ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteined her, it had not ben poſſible for her to haue endured, but her hart muſt needes haue burſt in ſunder. In the end ſhe concluded her praier with theſe wordes. O Lord, ſaid ſhe ſeeing it is ſo, that thy mercie maie not be granted without thy Iuſtice. I beſeech thee, deſpiſe not my praiers, but whatſoeuer paine is to be laied vpon this people, laie it vpon my bodie, and I will beare it with all my hart,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:8350:148"/> for the loue, that I beare to the honour of thy holie name, and to the ſaluation of their ſoules. After the tyme, that ſhe had ſpoken theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, our Lord made no more mention of his iuſtice, but held his peace, and gaue her the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie, as the effecte declared euidently; For from that verie hower foreward it was ſeene, that the people did by litle, and litle ceaſe off their conſpiracies and practiſes againſt the Popes holines, and in the end ſubmitted them ſelues wholly to his authoritie. But as their malice relented by litle and litle, and in tyme ceaſed: ſo did her paine and ſmart like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe increaſe anſwerably, by the permiſſion of God: by whoſe ſuffrance the wicked ſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes vexed and tormented her bodie ſo cruelly, that it ſeemed incredible, but only to ſuch as were preſent with her, and ſawe, how it was, in part rent and torne, as it had ben with yron hookes, in part ſwollen and full of blacke and blewe wailes, as though it had ben beaten with clubbes, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo pitifully araied, that it ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a thing to wonder at, then a natural bodie. All the which notwithſtanding ſhe gaue not ouer her accuſtomed maner of praier, but continued in the ſame, both longer tyme toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then ſhe was wont to doe before, and alſo with greater feruour of ſpirite and deuotion, then ſhe was wont to haue at other tymes. And euermore, as ſhe increaſed in praier &amp; charitable
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:8350:149"/> affection towardes the Church of God, ſo did thoſe wicked feendes increaſe their crueltie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes her, beating and bounſing her daie and night, and withal filling her eares with their moſt horrible cries, ſaying. O thou curſed wretch, thou haſt euer ben againſt vs. But be thou well aſſured: the tymes is now come, that we will be euen with thee.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now we will neuer geue thee ouer, vntill we haue made a full riddance of thee, in ſuch ſort, that thou ſhalt neuer be able to hinder vs anie more. Thus much the holie maid wrote her ſelfe in a letter to Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> her ghoſtlie Father. And ſo ſhe continued in ſuch vexation and tormentes from the ſonday of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuageſima, vntill the laſt ſauing one of April: on the which daie it pleaſed our Lord to call her out of this life.</p>

                  <p>WHen <hi>Iames</hi> this holie maides father ſawe, that his daughter was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly geuen to the ſeruice of God (as it hath ben declared in the firſt part of this booke) he caſt a verie ſpecial loue and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to her, and entreated her in his houſe with great reſpecte and reuerence, and had this
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:8350:149"/> opinion of her, that ſhe was able to obteine at Gods hand for him, what ſhe would. And ſhe likewiſe bare a verie ſingular loue and reuerence to her father, and commended his health to God in her dailie praiers in moſt earneſt maner. It chaunced, that her father fell into a verie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſickenes, &amp; kept his bed. The which when ſhe vnderſtood, ſhe turned her ſelfe to God in praier after her accuſtomed maner, and beſought him, that her father might recouer againe. But anſwere was geuen her from God, that the end of his daies in this life was come, and that it was not expedient for him to liue anie longer. With that ſhe went foorthwith to her father, to viſite him, and to examine him, how he was diſpoſed in his ſoule: and found him readie and willing to paſſe out of this wordle, whenſoeuer it ſhould pleaſe God to call him: wherof ſhe was verie glad, and thanked our Lord with all her hart. Then she praied furthermore, that, ſeeing our Lord had voutchſafed to call her father out of this life in the ſtate of ſaluation, it might alſo ſtand with his holie will and pleaſure, to make him this graunt, that he might paſſe out of hand to the ioyes of heauen, &amp; not be ſtaied anie tyme in the paines of Purgatorie. Whereunto our Lord made her anſwere, that the order of iuſtice muſt needes be obſerued: which would not beare, that anie ſoule ſhould haue the fruition of thoſe vnſpeakeable ioyes, vnleſſe it were moſt perfectly purged before. And though her father
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:8350:150"/> had lead a conuenient good life in his vocation, and had done manie good workes alſo, which were verie acceptable in the ſight of God (of the which one principal worke was, the mainteinyng of her in religion) yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome ruſt of earthlie conuerſation, which of right muſt be tried out with the fyer of purgatorie. When ſhe heard that, ſhe made her praier to our Lord after this maner. O moſt mercifull Lord, how maie I abide, that the ſoule of my deere father, whome thou haſt appointed to be the meane to bring me into this wordle, by whome I haue ben ſo carefully prouided for in my tender age, at whoſe hand I haue receiued ſo manie comfortes and reliefes, by whoſe handie labour and charges, I haue ben mainteined thus maine yeares in thy ſeruice, ſhould now be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the paines of Purgatorie? I beſeech thee, O father of mercies and God of all comfort, for all the louing kindnes, that euer thou haſt ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to mankind, that thou wilt not ſuffer my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſowle to depart out of his bodie, vntill it be by one meane or other ſo perfectly tried and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, that it need no further purgation. A won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing to conſider. After the tyme, that the holie maid had ſaid thoſe wordes, it was euiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ſeene, that her fathers bodie decaied more and more (as it did before) to wardes death, all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers failing ſenſibly in ſuch ſort, that all men ſawe, by the courſe of nature it could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue anie tyme. And yet, for ſo long time, as ſhe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:8350:150"/> continued in praier, wreſtling (as it were) with almightie God, and labouring to incline him in ſome degree (if it were poſsible) from iuſtice to mercie: they might perceiue, that his ſoule was holden in his bodie by ſome ſpiritual power, and could in no wiſe depart. At the length, when ſhe ſawe, that the iuſtice of God muſt needes be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied: ſhe ſaid thus. O moſt merciful Lord, if it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not otherwiſe be, but that thy iuſtice muſt be anſwered.

With that ſhe thanked God moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly, and ſaid. O Lord, thy iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes are all iuſt: be it done to me, as thou haſt determined.

All the which notwithſtanding she was ſo drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the wordle, that she might in no wiſe heare of death, and be brought to confourme her will to the will of God.

Our Lord made anſwere, that, if she could be brought to diſpoſe her ſelfe to die at

But the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, geuing but a deaffe eare to this kind of talke, charged her daughter earneſtly, that she should rather praie to God for the continuance of her life: for as yet she could in no wiſe be brought to depart out of the wordle.

But she was ſo fixed on the wordle, that she might not abide to heare of death. Whereupon our Lord ſpeake to the holie maid after this ſort. Daughter, ſaid he, tell thy mother, that if she will not conſent to die now, a tyme shall come, when she ſhalbe ſo afflicted, that ſhe shall deſire to die, and shall not be heard. Which ſaying of our Lord tooke effecte within a litle tyme after: and she was in deed ſo miſerably tormented in

Is it poſsible, that God hath ſo incloſed my ſoule in this crooked bodie, that it can find no waie out? Haue I ſent ſo manie of my ſonnes and daughters, kinsfolkes and frindes, housband and all out of the wordle before me with great griefe, and now am conſtreined to remaine here alone after them all, to ſee my ſelfe ouerwhelmed with heauines and miſerie? And ſo with this bitternes of hart and murmuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, ſhe paſſed out of this life, without anie further contrition or repentance for her ſynnes. Her daughter tooke this maner of her departure meruelous heauily, and could receiue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort: but, ſetting her ſelfe to praier (which ſhe had euermore tried to be a preſent remedie againſt all euels) ſhe ſighed, ſobbed, and wept verie lamentably, and powred out the griefe of her hart before God with theſe wordes. O my deere Lord and God, are theſe the promiſes, that thou haſt made me, that there ſhould no one of my houſe and familie perish in the handes of the enemie? Behold ô Lord, my mother is now paſſed out of this life without repentance for her ſynnes, without confeſsion, without the rightes of holie Church. O ſweet Lord, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all comfort, I moſt humbly beſeech thee in the bowels of thy tender mercie, that thou

                     <p>How the holie maid obteined of God by praier the conuerſion of two theeues, that were lead to execution.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 10.</head>
                  <p>ON a daie, while the holie maid was in the houſe of one of her ſiſters called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexia,</hi> it cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced, that two famoꝰ theeues condemned to death were caried in a cart thorough the ſtreete towardes the place of execution. Their ſentence was, that by the waie, as they were caried, they should be pinched now in one part of their bodie, and now in an other with hote yrons or pincers, and ſo in the end put to death. Which paine was ſo intolerable, that they (which were before in a deſperate ſtate, and might by no perſwaſions be brought to repent them of their manifold and heinous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences committed againſt God and the wordle) blaſphemed God &amp; all his Sainctes. In ſo much that it ſeemed, that the temporal tormentes, that they were now in, were but a begynning and waie to theſe euerlaſting tormentes and fyer, that they went vnto. But our merciful Lord, whoſe prouident goodnes diſpoſeth all thinges ſweetly, had otherwiſe determined of them. When they were come neere to this houſe, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexia</hi> hearing a great concourſe, and noyſe of people in the ſtreete, went to the windowe, to ſee, what it might be. And ſeeing the horrible maner of the execution, ſhe ranne in againe, and
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:8350:153"/> ſaid to the holie maid. O mother; if euer you will ſee, a pitiful ſight, come now. With that the holie maid went to the windowe and looked out: and ſo ſoone as ſhe had ſeene the maner of the execution, ſhe returned foorthwith to her praiers againe. For (as ſhe declared afterwardes ſecretly to Doctour <hi>Raimundus)</hi> ſhe ſawe a great multitude of wicked ſpirites about thoſe fellons, which did burne their ſoules more cruelly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then the tormentours did their bodies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Which lamentable ſight moued her to dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble compaſsion. She had great pitie to ſee their bodies: but much more to ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> their ſoules, wherefore turning her ſelfe to our Lord with great feruour of ſpirite, ſhe made her praier to him after this maner. Ah deere Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doſt thou ſuffer theſe thy creatures, made to thyne owne image and likenes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed with the price of thy moſt precious blood, to be thus lead awaie in triumph by the cruel enemie? I know, ô Lord, &amp; confeſſe, that theſe men are iuſtly punished according to the meaſure of their offences. So was the theefe alſo, that hong by thee on the Croſſe: whom notwithſtanding thou tookeſt to mercie, ſaying that he should be with thee that verie daie in Paradyſe. Thou diddeſt not refuſe <hi>Peeter,</hi> but ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt him a frindlie and comfortable looke, though he, like an vnkind man, had thrice refuſed and denied thee. Thou dreweſt Marie <hi>Magdalen</hi> to thee with the lines of loue, when ſhe had eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:8350:154"/> her ſelfe from thee by her manifold ſynnes. Thou tookeſt <hi>Mathewe</hi> the Publicane from a ſynful trade of life in the wordle, to be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and Euangeliſt. Thou diddeſt not repell the woman of Cananee, nor <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Prince of Publicans, but dideſt moſt ſweetly accept the one and inuite the other. Wherefore I moſt humbly beſeech thee, for all thy mercies, hitherto ſhewed vnto man, and for all thoſe alſo, that thyne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodnes hath determined to ſhewe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that thou wilt voutchſafe to looke downe vpon theſe wretched creatures, &amp; mollifie their hartes with the fyer of thy holie ſpirite, that they maie be deliuered from the ſecond death. Our Lord heard the praier of his Spowſe, and graunted her ſuch a grace, that ſhe went in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite with thoſe two theeues towardes the place of execution, weeping and lamenting for their ſynnes, and mouing them to repentance for the ſame. Which thing the wicked ſprites perceiued well inough: and therefore they cried out vpon her, and ſaid. <hi>Catherine,</hi> leaue to trouble vs. If thou wilt not, we will ſurely enter into thee and vexe thee. To whom the holie maid made this anſwere. As God will, ſo will I. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not ceaſe to doe, what lieth in me, for the reliefe of theſe poore wretches; becauſe I know, it is the will of God, that I ſhould ſo doe. And ſo continuing in praier, ſhe procured them a verie ſingular fauour and grace: as the effecte declared. For, when theſe theeues were come to
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:8350:154"/> the gate of the citie, our Sauiour Chriſt appeered to them, ſhewing to them his precious woundes all ſtreami<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g downe with blood, &amp; inuiting them to become repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tant for their former life. Which if they did, he put them in a ſure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, that all was quite forgeuen. At this ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſight their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were ſodainly ſo altered (to the great wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of as manie as were there preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) that they chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their ſtile, and turned their blaſphemie into tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>keſgeuing &amp; prayſing God for his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And, ſhewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be hartely ſorie &amp; contrite for their ſynnes, deſired earneſtly, that they might haue a Prieſt to heare their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. That done, they went forward cheerfully towar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des the place of executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: where they ſhewed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kewiſe great tokens of ioy &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, for that they had to paſſe by a reproachful death to a glorious life. All the people ſawe this ſtrange alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; were much aſtonied at it, becauſe as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the cauſe thereof: which afterwards came to light by this meane. The Prieſt, that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard theſe fello<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſoone after to viſit Doct. <hi>Rai:</hi> the holie maides Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſour, &amp; in talke declared vnto him, how wonderfully God had wrought, with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Doct. <hi>Rai:</hi> foorthwith bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuſpect, as it was indeed, &amp; therfore asked <hi>Alexia,</hi> what the holie maid was doi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g at that tyme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the theeues were lead thorough their ſtreet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the place of executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. She made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, &amp; declared the whole proceſſe of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſo much as ſhe had ſeene &amp; heard in her owne houſe.
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:8350:155"/> Whereby Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> ſawe a verie great likelihood, that the thing had ben wrought (as he deemed before) by the praier and interceſſion of the holie maid. Howbeit for the more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance he tooke an occaſion afterwardes to aske the holie maid her ſelfe. And ſhe (to the honour of God, and for the ſatisfaction of her ghoſtlie father) declared vnto him particularly, how e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie thing had paſſed. Within a fewe daies, after this was done, certaine of the ſiſters, that chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be preſent, while the holie maid was praying, heard her ſaie theſe wordes in her praier with a full voice. O Lord Ieſu, I moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely thanke thee, that thou haſt deliuered them out of the ſecond priſon. Of the which wordes being demaunded afterwardes, what ſhe meant by them, ſhe made anſwere, that the ſoules of thoſe theeues were as then deliuered out of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, and reſtored to Paradyſe. Such was her charitie towardes them, that, as ſhe had by praier deliuered them from the euerlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of hell, ſo ſhe neuer ceaſed to praie for them, vntill she ſawe, that they were alſo paſſed the temporal paines of Purgatorie, and receiued into euerlaſting bliſſe.</p>

                  <p>THere was a man dwelling in the citie of Siena called <hi>Andrewe Mardine,</hi> well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with wordlie ſubſtance, but bare of heauenlie ritches, void of the loue and feare of God, a baretter, blaſphemer, and wicked liuer. This man about the fortieth yeare of his age, was ſodainly taken with a verie grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſickenes, which held him ſo vehemently, that he was faine to keepe his bed, where he laie &amp; waxed euerie daie weaker &amp; weaker vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at the length he was geuen, ouer by the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicions and deſpaired of all men. His curate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, came to viſite him, and (as his Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charge required) exhorted him with manie wordes, that he ſhould now in the end of his life, diſpoſe him ſelfe to Confeſſion and penance for his ſoules health. But he was ſo obſtinately bent, that he litle eſteemed the Prieſt, and leſſe his counſel. Which thing his wife perceiuing (which was a good woman, and had a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſawe her husbandes ſoule) ranne to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundrie religious perſones, both men and women, &amp; beſought them, that they would come and doe their diligence to turne his hart. They came at her inſtance, and vſed manie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſible meanes to bring him to a better mynd, ſetting before his eyes now the horrible threates
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:8350:156"/> of hell fyer, and now the ſweete peomiſes of the ioyes of heauen: but all in vaine. After them came the curate againe, with great heauines and care to doe, what in him laie, towardes the recouerie of this ſowle, that was thus in danger to periſh. He exhorted him (as he had done before) and thereunto added manie good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſwaſions, to induce him to be repentant for his foremer life, and to call to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. But the wretched mans hart was ſo har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, that he might not endure to heare him ſpeake, but ſcorned both him and his holeſome exhortations. In ſo much that at the lenght he fell into plaine deſperation and ſynne againſt the holie Ghoſt: and in that damnable ſtate drewe on a pace towardes his end. This mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter chanced to come to the knowledge of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Thomas,</hi> who, hauing great compaſsion of the wretched mans caſe, went foorthwith towardes the holie Maides lodging, hoping by her mediation to find ſome grace in the ſight of God. But when he came thither, he found the holie maid rauiſhed from her bodilie ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And ſo long as ſhe was ſo, he durſt not doe anie thing to her bodie, wherby to bring her againe: and tarrie there anie longer he might not, bicauſe it wae verie late in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng. Wherefore he gaue a verie ſtreight char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to one of the ſiſters, that was there with her at that tyme, that, when the holie maid came to her ſelfe againe, ſhe ſhould deſire
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:8350:156"/> her in his name, and alſo charge her in the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of her obedience, that ſhe ſhould extend her charitie towardes that miſerable man, that laie on paſsing, and praie to God hartely for his recouerie. When the holie maid vnderſtood the lamentable ſtate of the ſicke man, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all the charge, that was geauen her from her ghoſtlie father, ſhe taried not, but foorthwith ſet her ſelfe to praier, and beſought our Lord with great inſtance and feruour of ſpirite, that he would not ſuffer that ſoule to periſh, whome he had redeemed with the price of his moſt precious blood. To that our Lord made anſwere and ſaid, that the iniquitie of that wicked man was ſo heinous in his ſight, that the crie thereof perced the heauens and called for iuſtice; for he had not only in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des moſt horribly blaſphemed the holie name of God and of his Sainctes, but alſo with great deſpite and malice throwen a table into the fyer, in the which was painted the death and paſsion of our Sauiour Chriſt, together with the images of our bleſſed Ladie and other Sainctes. By the which facte he had deſerued euerlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When the holie maid heard that, ſhe fell downe proſtrate before our Lord, and ſaid. O Lord, if thou wilt looke narrowly to our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who ſhalbe able to ſtand? Wherefore ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt thou downe from heauen into the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle? Wherefore tookeſt thou fleſh of the moſt pure and vnſpotted virgin <hi>Marie?</hi> Wherefore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:8350:157"/> diddeſt thou ſuffer a moſt bitter and reprochfull death? Haſt thou done all theſe thinges, ô Lord, to this end, that thou mighteſt call men to a ſtreight and rigorous account for their ſynnes, and not rather, that thou mighteſt vtterly can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel their debtes and take them to mercie? Why doſt thou, ô merciful Lord, tell me of the ſynnes of one loſt man, ſeeing thou haſt borne vpon thyne owne ſhoulders, the ſynnes of the whole wordle, that none ſhould be loſt? Doe I lie here proſtrate at thy feete to demaund iuſtice, and not rather to craue mercie? Doe I preſent my ſelfe here before thy diuine Maieſtie, to pleade the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie of this wretched creature, and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confeſſe, that he is gyltie of euerlaſting death and damnation, and that the onlie refuge is, to appeale to thyne endles mercie? Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ô deere Lord, what thou ſaideſt to me, when thou diddeſt firſt will me to goe abrode, and to procure the ſaluation of manie ſoules. Thou knoweſt right well, that I haue none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ioye or comfort in this life, but only to ſee the conuerſion of ſynners vnto thee. And for this cauſe only I am content to lacke the ioyful fruition of thy bleſſed preſence. Wherefore, if thou take this ioye from me, what other thing ſhall I find in this vale of miſerie, wherein to take pleaſure or comfort? O moſt merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; God of all comfort, reiecte not the hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble petition of thyne handmaid, put me not awaie from thee at this tyme; but graciouſly graunt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:8350:157"/> me, that this my brothers hard hart maie be mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, and made to yeald to the working of thy holie ſpirite. Thus did the holie maid continue in praier and diſputation with our Lord, from the begynning of the night till the nexte mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. All the which tyme ſhe neither ſlept nor tooke anie maner of reſt: but wept and wailed continually, for great compaſſion, that ſhe had, to ſee that ſoule periſh: our Lord euermore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaging his iuſtice, and ſhe crauing his mercie. At the length our Lord, being as it were ouercome with her importunitie and crying, gaue her this comfortable anſwere. Deere daughter, I will ſtand no longer with thee in this matter. Thy teares and lamentable crying haue preuailed, and wreſted the ſword of my iuſtice out of myne hand. This ſynful man ſhall for thy ſake find ſuch fauour and grace, as thou requireſt for him. And with that our Lord withdrewe him ſelfe from the holie maid, and appeered the ſame hower to the ſicke man, and ſpake to him after this maner. Deere child, why wilt thou not be repentant for the ſynnes, that thou haſt committed againſt me? In anie caſe be ſorie for thyne offences, and confeſſe the ſame: and I am readie to pardon thee. That word ſo perſed the hart of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate man, that he relented foorth with, and cried with a lowd voice to them, that were there preſent, &amp; beſought them for Gods loue, that they would helpe him to a ghoſtlie father with all poſsible ſpeed. For (ſaid he) my Lord
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:8350:158"/> and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhewed him ſelfe mercifully to me, and willed me to be confeſſed of all my ſynnes. When they heard that, they were verie much aſtoined (but withall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſly comforted) to ſee that ſoddaine and bleſſed alteration in him. And they made great haſt to bring him a ghoſtlie father: to whome he made a perfecte Confeſsion of all his ſynnes with great contrition, and ſo paſſed out of this wordle in the ſtate of grace.</p>

                  <p>THere was in the citie of Siena a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a worſhipfull parentage, called <hi>Francis Tolomes,</hi> who tooke to wife on <hi>Rabes</hi> a gentlewoman like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a good howſe, and by her had manie ſonnes and daughters. His eldeſt ſonne was called <hi>Iames,</hi> a prowd and hawtie yong man, and of nature verie fierce and cruel: in ſo much that being yet but a child of age, he killed two men with his owne handes: which cawſed all men both to dread him, and to ſhunne his companie. And as he grewe in yeares, ſo did he alſo increaſe in malice and wickednes, and ranne without raine or bridle euen as his outragious mynd caried him into
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:8350:158"/> all kindes of miſchiefe. He had two ſiſters, the one called <hi>Francis,</hi> the other <hi>Ginoccia:</hi> which were alſo diſſolute and light of behauiour, and ſpecially <hi>Ginoccia,</hi> which was wholly geuen to vaintie and ſuperfluous decking of her ſelfe. And yet had ſhe euermore a care to keepe the virginitie of her bodie: which ſhe did, rather for feare of ſhame in the wordle, then for anie feare or loue of God. Which thing was no ſmall griefe to their mother <hi>Rabes:</hi> who being a woman, that feared God, and tendred much the ſoules health of her daughters, went on a daie to the holie maid, and declaring the ſtate of her daughters, beſought her for Gods loue, that ſhe would bee ſo good, as to come with her, and geue them ſome godlie exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. The holie maid, which had euermore a paſsing great deſire to wynne ſoules to God, went with the gentlewoman with a verie good will, and did as ſhe was required. And her wordes ſo wrought in the hartes of thoſe two yong maidens, that they gaue ouer all the vanities of the wordle, and tooke the habite of S. <hi>Dominicke, Ginoccia</hi> foorth with, and <hi>Francis</hi> ſoone after. In the which rule and diſcipline they liued a verie ſtreight and rigorous life: eſpecially <hi>Ginoccia</hi> which of the two liued in greater auſteritie and penance. When their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iames,</hi> who was at that tyme abroade, heard tell of this ſtrange alteration of his two ſiſters, he raged like a mad man, and curſed all
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:8350:159"/> them, that had moued his ſiſters to take that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite. And he threatned verie boldly, that he would teare thoſe garmentes from their backes, and bring them home againe. And no man durſt aduenture to ſtaie him in that rage, but only a yong brother of his, that was in companie with him at that tyme, who ſpake to him after this maner. Brother <hi>Iames,</hi> ſaid he, you are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queinted with this ſiſter <hi>Catherine.</hi> But if you goe to <hi>Siena,</hi> you ſhall ſee; ſhe ſhall turne you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and make you to goe Confeſsion. To Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetsion, ſaid he? I defie thee and them all. Aſſure thy ſelfe, I will cut the throtes of all thoſe Prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and friars, before they ſhall bring me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. Well brother, ſaid the child (and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his wordes oftentymes, ſpeaking with great affiance, as though he had foreſeene the euent of this matter in the ſpirite of prophecie) you ſhall find my wordes true, and ſhall ſee, that the holie maid ſhall bring you to grace. Thoſe wordes ſet him in ſuch a furie, that he curſed and banned, and fared like a man diſtracted. And in this furie he entred into the citie, and went foorth with to his fathers houſe: where he tooke on like a madd man, threatnyng and ſwearing, that he would doe manie horrible miſchiefes, vnleſſe they brought to paſſe, that his ſiſters, and ſpecially <hi>Ginoccia</hi> might put off that habite, and come home againe. But his mother <hi>Rabes,</hi> who was well acqueinted with his furious nature, &amp; therefore feared, leſt he would of a ſodaine do
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:8350:159"/> ſome miſchieuous acte (as his maner was) came to him, and with faire wordes ſtaied his rage, that he did no harme that night. And the next morning ſhe ſent for Doctour <hi>Thomas,</hi> beſeeching him for Gods ſake, that he would take the pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to come, and geue her ſonne <hi>Iames</hi> ſome go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlie exhortation. Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> came, &amp; with him frier <hi>Bartilmewe.</hi> And they ſpake manie good wordes to the impatient yong man: but, for ought, that they could perceiue, all in vaine. All this tyme was the holie maid in praier, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured earneſtly to wynne that yong mans ſoule to God: for ſhe vnderſtood (not by the relation of anie man, but only by reuelation from God) in what a damnable ſtate he ſtood: and she ſawe in ſpirite, what paines thoſe good men tooke to recouer him. And it was euidently ſeene after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes by the proofe, that our Lord bleſſed and furthered their charitable trauaile in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe for the holie maides ſake, and in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of her deuout praiers. For when theſe men had ſpent a good tyme about him, and ſawe, that they could doe him no good: at the length, while Doctour <hi>Bartilmewe</hi> was ſpeaking to him, behold, of a ſodaine, and contrarie to all expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the yong man (being vndoubtedly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the finger of God) reſented and ſaid of him ſelfe, that he was verie well content and glad, that his ſiſters should ſerue God in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie rule and diſcipline. And he required further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more with great humilitie, that he might be
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:8350:160"/> Confeſſed and abſolued of his owne ſynnes, that he might ſerue God with them alſo. The which he did in deed verie perfectly, to the great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and comfort of as manie as were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: which a litle before had ſeene him as fiercc as a lion, and now as myld as a lambe. His mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rabes</hi> was a ioyful woman, to ſee this ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge and bleſſed alteration in her ſonne, and ſo were all the reſt of her familie with her. Now, when Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> and Doctour <hi>Bartilmewe</hi> his companion had rendred thankes to almightie God for this great mercie ſhewed vpon that yong man, they went out of hand with ioyful hartes towardes the holie maides lodging, and thought the tyme long, vntill they might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part theſe glad tidinges of his conuerſion to her. But when they came thither, they vnderſtood, that the holie maid was aboue in an vpper chamber in praier, and rauiſhed (as her maner was) in ſpirite, and one other of the ſiſters with her. By reaſon wherof they were conſtreined to tarrie a while. At the length, when the holie maid was come to her ſelfe againe, that other ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter came downe to enterteine Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her Confeſſour: who ſaluted her with a cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful countenance, and began foorthwith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the cauſe of his coming to her. Siſter, ſaid he, we are come to bring you verie good newes. Maiſter <hi>Iames Tolmes</hi> is by the grace of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a newe man, and this mornyng hath made a general Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſsion of all his ſynnes to Doctour

                     <hi>Bartilmewe.</hi> Father, ſaid that ſiſter, we haue great cauſe both to reioyſe, and alſo to thanke our Lord for theſe ioyful tydinges. Howbeit they are no newes to vs: for ſiſter <hi>Catherine,</hi> before I came downe to you, told me ſo much, as you tell me now. And with that they went vp into the vpper chamber to the holie maid: who immediatly vpon their entrie, ſpake to them after this maner. Fathers, ſaid ſhe, we are much bound to thanke our Lord and Sauiour, that neuer diſpiſeth the humble praier of his ſeruantes. And as he putteth holie deſires into their hartes, ſo doth he alſo accompliſh the ſame to their benefite, and comfort. The wicked feend had thought to haue gotten a litle lambe, of the which he had conceiued ſome hope. But he hath (through the vnſpeakeable goodnes of God) loſt a great preie, of the which he had full poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. He laid for <hi>Ginoccia:</hi> but he hath loſt <hi>Iames.</hi> And ſo it falleth out oftentymes with this rauenous and inſatiable wolfe, that, while he openeth his iawes wider to geat more, he both letteth fall ſome better mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, that he had in his mouth before, and yet miſſeth of that other thing, that he ſo griedily ſnatcheth after. Our Lord be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and thanked for euer more: whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident wiſedome diſpoſeth all thinges ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely, and turneth the wilye malice of this ſuttle ſerpent, to the benefit and comfort of his
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:8350:161"/> choſen ſeruantes. After this <hi>Ginoccia</hi> continued without anie moleſtation in that holie ſtate of life, that ſhe had vowed: wherein, when ſhe had ſuffered manie ſickeneſſes with a verie pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and cheereful mynd, ſhe paſſed out of this wordle to God, with a meruelous inward ſweetnes and comfort, as it was euidently ſeene by the maner of her departure.

And it was noted of her alſo, at the tyme of her paſſing out of this life, that ſhe ſmyled ſweetely, and ſhewed great tokens of ſpiritual ioye, euen when ſhe was at the verie point of death. And this <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> their brother, after that he was thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the deuout praier of the holie maid and diligence of good men, became a newe man, and liued in the ſtate of matrimonie a verie quiet and orderlie life, to the great comfort of his frindes, and example of vertue to as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, as chaunced to conuerſe with him.</p>

                  <p>THere was in the cittie of Siena a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful gentleman called <hi>Nannes de Vannis:</hi> which bare a great ſwaie emong the people, by reaſon that, as he was a verie fierce and warlike man, ſo he was alſo of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelous ſuttle and craftie wit to deale in wordlie affaires. This <hi>Nannes</hi> with the reſt of his familie, allies, and frindes, mainteined a faction and perpetual quarrel againſt certaine other fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies in the cittie: who dreading his power and policie, ſought by meanes and with great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to make their peace with him. He made them anſwere, that it was all one to him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they had peace or no peace, and that for his owne part, he was verie readie and willing to come to accord, if they could wynne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other to it, to whome it apperteined as well as to him ſelfe. And thus he gaue them verie faire wordes, and put them in hope of peace: but in the meane tyme he dealt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly with thoſe other perſones, willing them to ſtand ſtiffely to it, and in no wiſe to condeſcend to anie condicions of peace. This matter came to the eares of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie maid: which, ſeeing herein a goodlie occaſion miniſtred vnto her of working a verie charitable
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:8350:162"/> worke, ſought by manie meanes to ſpeake with him. But euermore, when he vnderſtood, that ſhe was comyng towardes him, he fled from her, euen as the ſerpent is wont to flee from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantour, that cometh to charme him. At the length, by the importunitie of a certaine holie Heremite of S. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> order, called brother <hi>VVilliam,</hi> an Engliſh man, they wonne ſo much of him, that he was content to heare the holie maid ſpeake, but yet with this proteſtation, that, whatſoeuer ſhe ſaid concernyng the accord, he was fixed, and would not be remoued. And with this reſolution he went to the holie maides houſe, at a tyme, when ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode by a verie vrgent occaſion of procuring the health of ſoules. But Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> by the prouidence of God was there at that tyme: who vnderſtanding, that <hi>Nannes</hi> was comyng, was verie glad of it (for he knewe, that the holie maid had a great deſire to ſpeake with him.) Wherefore he went out to meete with him, and to geue him enterteinement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till her returne. When they were come into the houſe, Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> lead him the waie into the holie maides chapple or orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: where he cauſed him to ſit downe, and miniſtred ſuch talke vnto him, as he thought moſt conuenient to protracte the tyme. But, after that they had ſate there a litle while, and ſawe that ſhe came not: <hi>Nannes,</hi> thought the tyme long, and therefore began to breake
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:8350:162"/> with Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> after this maner. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid he, I promiſed brother <hi>VVilliam,</hi> that I would come hither and ſpeake with the holie maid. But now, ſeeing ſhe is abrode about ſome other buſines, and I haue at this preſent certaine affaires, that muſt needes be diſpatched out of hand: I praie you, excuſe me vnto her, and tell her, that I would gladly haue ſpoken with her, if ſhe had ben at home. Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> was verie ſorie, that the holie maid came not awaie. Howbeit to wynne yet a litle more tyme, he tooke occaſion to enter in talke with him concernyng the peace, and asked him, how the matter ſtood betweene ſuch and ſuch perſones. Whereunto he made anſwere after this maner. Father; ſaid he, to you that are a prieſt and religious, and to this bleſſed maid, of whome I heare report of great vertue and holines, I will make no lie, but tell you plainely and ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely, how the caſe ſtandeth betweene theſe men. True it is, that I am he, that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this accord and agreement: though in deed it ſeeme otherwiſe, becauſe the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is openly contriued by others. I alone do priuily mainteine and vphold one ſide: and if I alone would geue my conſent to the peace, the matter were ended. But, to tell you my meanyng in fewe wordes, my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace ſhalbe made and firmed with the blood of myne aduerſaries. This is my reſolution,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:8350:163"/> and from this I will not be remoued. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I praie you, ſet your hartes at reſt, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me no more. And with that he roſe vp, and tooke his leaue to depart. But Doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> was verie loth to let him goe: and therefore, though he ſawe, that he was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to tarrie there, and for that cauſe loth alſo to heare anie moe wordes of that, or anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, yet did he (to gaine more tyme) aske him diuerſe and ſundrie queſtions, and by that meanes held him there ſo long, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie maid was come home and entred into the houſe, before he could get out of the oratorie. When <hi>Nannes</hi> ſawe the holie maid, he was ſorie, that he had taried ſo long. But ſhe was right glad to ſee him there, and bad him welcome after a verie charitable and louing maner, and cauſed him to ſit downe againe. And when he was ſette, ſhe asked him the cauſe of his comyng. He made her anſwere, and declared ſo much in effecte, as he had declared before to Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> adding his proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion withal, that concernyng that matter of the peace, he would abide no talke: for he was reſolutely bent to the contrarie. The holie maid hearing that, began to exhort him to brotherlie loue and concord, and ſhewed him withal, what a dangerous and damnable ſtate they were in, that liued out of charitie. But he gaue but a deaffe eare to her wordes. Which thing ſhe perceaued well inough: and
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:8350:163"/> therefore ſhe ſate ſtill, and ſpake no more to him, but, caſting vp her eyes and hart to God, ſhe beſought him of grace and mercie for that hard harted man. When Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> which had euermore a diligent eye to the holie maid, had eſpied that, he ſpake ſome wordes to <hi>Nannes</hi> to occupie him the while: nothing doubting, but that ſhe ſhould worke ſome better effecte in him by that ſilent praier, then both he and ſhe had done before with manie wordes. And ſo it prooued in deed: for within a litle tyme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſpake to them both after this maner. It ſhall not be ſaid of me, that I am ſo hard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, that I will haue myne owne mynd in all thinges, and relent in nothing. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to your mynd in ſome one thing, and then I will take my leaue of you. I haue fower quarels in the cittie: of the which I am content to put one into your handes. Doe in it, what you ſhall thinke good, make you my peace: and I will abide your order. With that he roſe vp, and would haue gone his waie. But in the riſing, being inwardly touched, he ſaid theſe wordes to him ſelfe. O Lord, what comfort is this, that I feele at this inſtant in my ſoule, vpon the only namyng of this word (peace?) And ſoone after he ſaid againe. O Lord, O God, what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue or ſtrength is this, that holdeth and draweth me after this ſort? I haue no power to goe hence: I can denie you nothing, that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:8350:164"/> you require me. O Lord, ô Lord, what thing maie this be, that thus enforceth me? And with that he burſt out into weeping, and ſaid. I am quite ouerthrowen: I am not able to make anie longer reſiſtance. Then ſodainly he caſt him ſelfe downe at the holie maides feete, and with meruelous great ſubmiſsion and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of teares ſaid theſe wordes. O bleſſed maid, I am readie to doe, whatſoeuer you commaund me, not only in this matter of peace, but alſo in all other thinges, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they be. Hitherto, I knowe well, the deuel hath lead me vp and downe faſt tied in his chaine, but now I am reſolued to folowe you, whether ſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe you to lead me; And therefore I praie you for charities ſake, be you my guide, and teach me, how I maie deliuer my ſoule out of his bandes. At thoſe wordes, the holie maid turned to him, and ſaid. Brother, our Lord be thanked, that you are now, through his great mercie, come to vnderſtand, in how dangerous a ſtate you ſtood. I ſpake to you concernyng your ſoules health: and you made light of my wordes. I ſpake to our Lord touching the ſame matter, and he was content to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are me. My aduiſe therefore is, that you do penance for your ſynnes in tyme, for feare of ſome ſodaine calamitie, that maie fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon you, which, finding you vnprouided, maie otherwiſe beare you downe and quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:8350:164"/> you. This gentleman was ſo inwardly ſtriken with theſe wordes of the holie maid, that he went foorthwith to Doctour <hi>Raimun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and made a generall Confeſſion of all his ſynnes with great ſorrowe and contrition. And ſo, when he had made his peace with almightie God, by the aduiſe of Doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> and vertue of the holie Sacrament of penance: he was content likewiſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe to the order of the holie maid, and according to her direction and arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make a firme peace with all his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries. Within a fewe daies, after this <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> was thus conuerted, it chaunced, that he was taken by the gouernour of the citie, and caſt into a ſtreight priſon, for certaine ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trages, that he had committed before. And it was commonly talked emong the people, that he ſhould be put to death. The which when Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> vnderſtood, he came to the holie maid with a heauie cheere, and ſaid. Loe, mother, ſo long as <hi>Mannes</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the deuel, ſo long did all thinges goe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperouſly with him. But now, ſence the tyme, that he began to ſerue God, we ſee, the wordle is wholly bent againſt him. This ſodaine alteration putteth me in great doubt and feare of the man, leſt, being as yet but a yong and tender branch, he ſhould be broken of by the violence of this ſtorme, and ſo fall into deſpaire. Wherefore I
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:8350:165"/> beſeech you hartely, good mother, commmend his ſtate to God in your praiers. And as you haue by your mediation deliuered him from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting death, ſo doe your endeuour alſo to deliuer him from this temporall and imminent danger. To that the holie maid made anſwere; Father, ſaid ſhe, whie take you this matter ſo heauily? Me thinketh, you ſhould rather be glad of it. for by this you maie conceiue a verie ſure hope, that our Lord hath pardoned him all his ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and changed thoſe euerlaſting paines, that were due to him for the ſame, into theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall afflictions. When he was of the wordle, the wordle made much of him: as one that was his owne. But nowe, ſence he began to ſpoorne at the wordle, no meruaile, if the wordle do likewiſe kicke at him againe. As for the feare, that you haue, leſt he, being ouerlaied with theſe calamities, ſhould fall into deſpaire: be of good comfort, and aſſure your ſelfe, that the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodnes of our Lord, that hath deliuered him out of the deepe dongeon of hell, will not ſuffer him to periſh in priſon. And as ſhe ſaid, ſo it prooued in deed. For within a fewe daies after he was deliuered out of priſon. His life was in deed ſpared, but for that, they ſet a great fyne of money on his head. Whereof the holie maid was nothing ſorie, but rather glad: for, ſaid ſhe, our Lord hath mercifully taken awaie from him tha poiſon, with the which he had before, and might agine, haue poiſoned him ſelfe. So ſoone
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:8350:165"/> as this <hi>Mannes</hi> was thus deliuered, he like a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull gentleman, aſcribing the benefite both of his foremer recouerie out of ſynne; and alſo of this his deliuerie out of priſon, to the merites and praier of the holie maid, made a deed of gyfte to her of a goodlie palace, that he had, four myles from the citie. Of the which, by licence of Pope <hi>Grogorie</hi> the eleuenth, ſhe made a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterie for her ſpirituall daughters the ſiſters of penance, and dedicated it to our bleſſed Ladie, and in the honour of her, named the place. <hi>Our Lord of Angels?</hi> And he, after this happie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, was wholly directed by doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> and lead a verie bleſſed life.</p>

The which when the holie maid perceiued, ſhe gaue charge to the reſt that were about her, that they ſhould haue a care of the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſours, and prouide them of thinges neceſſarie. Which was in deed verie requiſite for they

                  <p>ABout the yeare of our Lord 1375. the citie of Florence, which had in fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes ſhewed it ſelfe euermore loiall and obedient to the Sea Apoſtolike, being moued, partly by the inſtigation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine euell diſpoſed citizens, that were in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and partly alſo (as it was thought) by the lewd demeanour of ſome inſolent perſones, that bare office in the Church, began to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe their obedience, and to ioyne them ſelues
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:8350:168"/> with the enemies of the Church. By reaſon whereof there enſued a general reuolt in Italie, almoſt of all the territories, that belonged to the Sea Apoſtolike: which were at that tyme (as it is reported) to the nomber of three ſcore cities, and ten thouſand walled townes. Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the eleuenth ſeeing that, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt the Florentines by waie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication: whereof it came to paſſe, that their merchantes and trauailers, whereſoeuer they went, were taken, robbed, and ſpoiled in all places, and debarred of all trafficke with other nations. The which ſmart and loſſe of temporal goods ſo pinched them, that they were enforced to ſeeke all poſsible meanes, how they might be reconciled to the Popes holines againe. And becauſe they vnderſtood, that the holie maid was in great credite and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Pope, by reaſon of her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holines: the lordes and principal ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the cittie thought good, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> her Confeſſour ſhould be ſent before, as it were to make her waie. And that done, they ſent for the holie maid alſo. And when ſhe was come almoſt to the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Florence: they went out againſt her, to receiue her with all honour: and beſought her for Gods loue, that ſhe would take the paines to goe to Auinion (where the Pope was then reſident) and to entreate him to condeſcend to certaine reaſonable condicions
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:8350:169"/> or peace. The holie maid had ſuch a paſsing deſire to make peace, that ſhe caſt no doubt neither of the trauaile and tediouſnes of the long iourney, nor yet of the effecte of her paines with the Popes holines, but tooke it vpon her with a verie good will. When ſhe came to Auinion, ſhe ſpake to the Pope ſo effectually, and vſed ſuch perſwaſible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to induce him to condeſcend to the peace, that he without anie further deliberation or ſticking at the matter, made her this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute anſwere. Daughter, ſaid he, that you maie ſee, how much I tender peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, I put the whole matter in your hand: Doe in it, as you ſhall thincke good. Only this, haue a regard to the honour of the Church. And with that he reuoked his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and ſentence of excommunication againſt the cittie of Florence: by reaſon wherof, they had ſome reſpite for a tyme, from ſuch vexations and troubles, as they ſuffred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all places, where they had trafficke with other nations. The which when cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine craftie perſones, that bare the ſwaie at that tyme emong the people, perceiued, they thought to vſe the oportunitie of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, to the furtherance of their malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which was to hinder the peace. And though they ſpake openly of pacification, yet did they worke couertly by all poſsible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to depraue and diſcredite, whatſoeuer
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:8350:169"/> was ſpoken or done for the confirmation of the ſame. In ſo much that, when the holie maid ſent the condicions of peace to them, requiring them to ſet their handes to them, and to make a publike inſtrument vpon the ſame (as the maner is, when anie compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of peace is made) they denied vtterly to doe it. The which thing Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> foreſawe verie well, and in deed ſaid theſe wordes to the holie maid, before ſhe ſent vnto them. Beleeue me, <hi>Catherine,</hi> (ſaid he) theſe Florentines haue beguyled thee. And either they will ſend thee none anſwere at all, or, if they doe, they will not doe it to ſuch effecte, as thou requireſt. And in truth as he ſaid, ſo it was; For afterwardes, when the Embaſſadours came from Florence to the Pope, and it was thought, that they ſhould haue conferred with the holie maid, they refuſed it plainely, and ſaid, that they had no ſuch commiſsion. The holie maid ſeeing that, was in deed verie ſorie to ſee ther vnhoneſt and craftie dealing. Howbeit ſhe ceaſed, not to aſſwage the diſpleaſure of the Popes holines iuſtly conceaued againſt them: and ſhe vſed meruelous meanes to perſwade him, that he ſhould rather ſhewe him ſelfe a pitiful father towardes them, then a rigorous iudge. While the matter ſtoode in theſe termes, the Pope, being reſolued to returne againe to the cittie of Rome
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:8350:170"/> (which was alſo wrought by the wonderful perſwaſion of the holie maid) thought good to differre this treatie of peace with the Florenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, vntill he came thither, where it might be done with better oportunitie. And ſo the Pope returnyng to Rome, the holie maid with Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> and the reſt of her companie went home to Siena: where ſhe buſied her ſelfe (after her accuſtomed maner) about the wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of ſoules to God.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>Cap. 17.</head>
                  <p>AT what tyme theſe thinges were in doing, it chanced, that Doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> was verie familiarly acqueinted with a worſhipful gentleman of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence called Maiſter <hi>Nicolas Soderines,</hi> who was well thought of emong all good men for ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and godlines. Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng with him on a tyme, and complainyng of the vniuſt dealyng of the Florentines in that treatie of peace, the gentleman made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that in truth it was the fault of ſome fewe; which being in office and authoritie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, were able to lead the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, where they liſted. And if thoſe fewe could by anie meanes be diſplaced, he doubted
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:8350:170"/> not, but that anie iuſt demaund would be heard emong the people. When Doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> had heard that, he conferred with the holie maid, and by her aduiſe drewe out cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine treaties of peace, which were thought both verie honorable, and alſo verie profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for both parties, if they might be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and exhibited the ſame to the Popes holines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſent from her. And declared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, what he had heard of the afore named gentleman, concernyng the hinderance of the ſaid peace. Within a fewe daies after, the Pope called for Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> againe, and ſpake vnto him. I haue (ſaid he) recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued letters, in the which it is ſignified vnto me, that, if the holie maid will goe to Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, the peace is like to be concluded. To that Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> made anſwere, that not only the holie maid, but he alſo, and all the reſt of her ſpiritual ſonnes and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, would be found readie at all tymes to offer them ſelues to Martyrdome, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer anie like occaſion was miniſtred, to ſhewe them ſelues dutiful and obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to our holie mother the Church. No, ſaid the Pope, I thinck it not good, that you ſhould goe at this tyme. It maie be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for you. But ſhe, being a woman, and alſo holden in great reuerence emong them for her vertue and holines, maie (I thinke) goe without anie danger. And ſo it
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:8350:171"/> was concluded: and the Pope wrote his letters to the cittie of Florence, in the which he gaue her a meruelous teſtimonie of holines: and with the ſame ſent her as an oratrice from the Sea A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolike. When ſhe came to Florence, ſhe was receiued of the godlier ſort with all honour and reuerence: and by the meanes of the afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Maiſter <hi>Nicolas Soderines,</hi> came to conferre priuately with manie of thoſe citizens, that liued in the feare of God: who were eaſilie induced by her to accepte the peace, that was offred vnto them by the Popes holines. After this ſhe went and conferred likewiſe with that companie or partie of the cittie, that were called <hi>Guelphi;</hi> and to them ſet out with manie vehement wordes, what a prowde, inſolent, and vngrateful part it was, to hinder that holie peace, calling thoſe fewe, that were the doers therof, enemies and vndoers of all common weale, and therefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meete to beare office emong the people. She de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared furthermore, what a profit was like to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue to their cittie, by that peace, if it might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, not only in their temporal goods, but alſo (and much more) for the furtherance &amp; edifying of ſoules. Then ſhe ſhewed the heynouſnes of their faicte to be ſuch, in the ſight both of God and man, that, if the rigour of lawes and iuſtice ſhould be exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon them, they had deſerued to be extremely puniſhed in bodie and ſoule. Laſt of all ſhe gaue them to vnderſtand, what a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie loue the Popes holines bare to them, and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:8350:171"/> how inclinable he was to ſhewe mercie, if they would ſubmit them ſelues &amp; ſeeke it at his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. And theſe pointes ſhe ſet out vnto them with ſuch a comelie grace &amp; with wordes of ſuch effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie, that all thoſe Magiſtrates, (with manie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt citizens) being brought by her talke into an vtter miſliking of their preſent trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſtate, and alſo into a great loue and longyng after that bleſſed peace, which, they ſawe euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly by her wordes, muſt needes turne them to ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie and comfort, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t foorth with to the lordes and nobilitie of the citie, &amp; perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in anie caſe they ſhould ſeeke to be reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciled to the Popes holines. And becauſe certaine perſones ther preſent had openly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned this peace, and ſpecially one capitaine or principal man of the partie called <hi>Guelphi,</hi> (which were in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber eight) had ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt it in plaine wordes, they depriued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their offices. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rof there enſued a great turmoyle in the citie, by reaſon that the perſones ſo depriued, for enuie &amp; malice, &amp; to be reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged of thoſe, that had cauſed it, ſought by the fauour of the people to cauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie other to be depriued alſo: &amp; in the end cauſed ſo manie to be depriued, that for lacke of diſcreete Magiſtrates, there grewe much diſorder in the common weale. And though the holie maid did ſhewe openly at all tymes &amp; in all places, that ſhe had no liking of theſe broiles, but rather great heauines &amp; ſorrow to ſee, that, whereas her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aning was to ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at vnitie &amp; concord abrode,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:8350:172"/> her charitable trauaile was, through the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of certaine euel diſpoſed perſones, made an occaſion of ciuile diſcord and tumult at home: yet there lacked not a nomber of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diueliſh men, which bare the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people in hand, that the holie maid and ſuch as ſhe dealt withal, were the cauſe of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe troubles in the citie. Whereupon firſt of all they bent them ſelues againſt thoſe men, that had ben doers in anie degree about the afore mentioned depriuation. And of them, ſome were driuen out of the cittie; ſome were ſlaine: and ſome were conſtreined to flee for feare. Then they began to make outcries againſt the holie maid her ſelfe. Some ſaid: Come, let vs goe to that naughtie womans houſe. Some others ſaid. Let vs kill the queanc, and cut her in peeces. With theſe and other the like wordes, thoſe good folkes, that kept her, were put in ſuch feare, leaſt ſome great miſchiefe might come either to them ſelues or to their houſes for her ſake, that they entreated her to depart. Whereat ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be no more moued (neither in wordes, nor yet in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance) then if there had ben no ſuch thing. But ſmyling ſweetely to her ſelfe (as her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was) and ſpeaking comfortably to the reſt, ſhe went her waie into an orchyard not farre from thence. Where, when ſhe had made an exhortation to thoſe deuout perſones, that were about her, ſhe ſet her ſelfe to praier. While the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:8350:172"/> holie maid was thus praying in the orchyard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fter the example of our Sauiour Chriſt, there came ruſhing in vpon her a fierce companie of cruell men, with clubbes, ſpeares, and ſwoordes readie drawen, ſhowting and crying horribly: Where is that naughtie woman? where is that curſed wretch? where is ſhe? With the noyſe of this outragious and beaſtlie crie, the holie maid, being, as it were, violently broken of the ſweet ſleepe of her meditation, ſtart vp ſodainly, and ranne to meete with them, with as louelie and cheerefull a countenance, as if ſhe had ben a yong ſpouſe, and had gone to receiue her loue, whom ſhe had long looked for. And ſeing emong them one man, that came on faſter then his companie, hauing a verie cruell and murdering looke, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his ſwoord after a dreadfull manner, and crying lowder then the reſt: where is the naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie woman; which is ſhe; which is <hi>Caterine:</hi> ſhe offred her ſelfe to him, and kneeling downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, ſaid. I am <hi>Caterine.</hi> Doe your will with me: but let theſe alone. At thoſe wordes, the cruell harted man, that came with a full purpoſe to ſtrike her, was ſo ſtriken himſelf, that he had neither ſtrength to hold vp his hand againſt her, nor boldnes to looke her once in the face. She kneeled boldly before him without anie weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and he ſtood trembling before her with his ſwoord in his hand. There lacked no will nor boldnes in her to receiue the ſtroke: but there lacked both ſtrength and courage in him to geue
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:8350:173"/> it. As it maie appeere by a letter, that ſhe wrote afterwardes to doctur <hi>Raimundus:</hi> in the which ſhe maketh a verie pitifull lamentation; that ſhe could not at that tyme effectually offer vp her blood to the vſpoted lambe of God, that had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vp his moſt precious blood ſo freely vpon the Croſſe for her loue. Now, though this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked attempt of theſe furious men was thus ſtaied by the mightie hand of God: Yet did there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſuch a feare ſtriken into the hartes of all good folkes, both of the citie, and of her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and retinue, that no man hauing the boldnes to receiue her into his houſe, they all gaue her counſell to depart. But ſhe, vpon a great affiance, that ſhe had in the mercifull goodnes of God, and alſo as a propheteſſe well aſſured of the finall ſucceſſe and effecte of the matter, ſaid in plaine wordes, that ſhe would neuer depart the citie, vntill the peace were fully and perfectly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Which thing came to paſſe within a fewe daies after, (euen as ſhe haid ſaid) when Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> was dead, and Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> choſen in his place. At what tyme the firſt mouers and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall workers of this tumult in the citie of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence were ſeuerely puniſhed, and ſpecially tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, that did anie thing againſt the holie maid. And a firme peace was made &amp; eſtabliſhed betweene the Popes holines and their cittie, to the honour of God, and great comfort not only of both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but of all Chriſtendome beſides.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 18.</head>
                  <p>YF anie man doubt, whether the holie maid were learned, let him reade her workes, namely her booke of Epiſtles, or the Dialogue, that ſhe wrote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the prouidence of God, and there is no doubt, but that he ſhalbe fully ſatisfied and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that no creature could euer haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch pointes of high and heauenlie learnyng without a verie ſpecial grace &amp; light geuen from God. And as ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to be diuinely learned by a nomber of bookes and treatiſes, that ſhe endited and ſet out to the wordle: ſo did ſhe alſo meruelouſly ſatisfie yea and paſſe the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of all learned men, that came of purpoſe to appoſe her, and to trie in deed, whether the opinion of ſuch excellent knowledge generally conceiued of her, had his true grownd in her, or rather in others: (as they ſuſpected.) Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng this point, a bleſſed and holie man called <hi>Steuen,</hi> ſometimes her goſtlie child &amp; trained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her diſcipline, &amp; afterwardes a monke of the Charterhouſe, writeth one verie notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple &amp; worthie to be remembred. The which can
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:8350:174"/> not better be ſet out, then with his owne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, which are theſe. When Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> being in Auinion, gaue much audience and reuerence to the holie maid, there came three great prelates vnto him, and ſaid. Holie father, how thinke you. This <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena is ſhe of ſuch great holines, as ſhe is reported to be? The Pope made anſwere. and ſaid. Truly, we beleeue, ſhe is a holie virgin. If it pleaſe your holines (ſaid they) we will goe to ſee her. And we beleeue (ſaid he) you ſhalbe well edified. And ſo they came to our houſe foorthwith, after nyne of the clocke in ſommer. When they knocked, I went to open the doore vnto them. And one of them ſaid to me: tell <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terine,</hi> that we would ſpeake with her. When ſhe vnderſtood of their being there, ſhe came downe with doctour <hi>Iohn</hi> her confeſſour and certaine other religious perſones in to one of the lower roomes: where, in a conuenient place, they cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to ſit downe in the middle. And ſo they entred talke with her after a verie inſolent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, prouoking her to choler with their biting wordes. And emong other thinges they ſaid. We come from the Popes holines, and are deſirous to vnderſtand of you, whether you be ſent from the Florentines, or no: as the common brute is. Haue not they one ſufficient man, to ſend about a matter of ſo great importance, vnto ſo great a prince? And if you be not ſent by them, we mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile much, how you, being a ſeelie woman dare preſume to treate of ſo weightie a matter, as
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:8350:174"/> this is with our holie father the Pope, &amp;c. But the holie maid ſtood faſt, like an vnmoueable pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and gaue them verie humble and pitthie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres: in ſo much that they merueiled much at it. And when ſhe had ſatisfied them at the full concernyng this matter: they put out vnto her verie manie, and withall verie great queſtions: eſpecially touching her abſtraction and ſingular manner of life. And bicauſe the Apoſtle ſaieth, that the angell of Satan transfourmeth him ſelfe into an angell of light, they asked her, how ſhe knewe, whether ſhe were deceiued or no. And ſo they ſpake manie wordes and propoſed manie queſtions, and in effecte protracted the tyme, vntill it was night. Sometymes Doctour <hi>Iohn</hi> would anſwere for her. And though he were a Doctour of diuinitie; yet were they ſuch great learned men, that in fewe wordes they ſhut him vp, and ſaid vnto him. You maie be aſhamed to ſpeake after this manner in our preſence. Let her anſwere for her ſelfe: for ſhe ſatisfieth vs much better, then you doe. Now, emong theſe three, one was an Archbiſhop, ſometymes a frier of S. <hi>Francis</hi> order, which bare him ſelfe like a proud Phariſee in countenance (as it appeered) and made ſometymes, as though he would not take the anſweres of the holie maid. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two at the length ſet themſelues againſt him; and ſaid. What would you haue more of this maid? Without doubt ſhe hath declared the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe matters more plainly and more copiouſly,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:8350:175"/> then euer we found them declared by anie of the doctours. And ſhe ſhewed manie moe verie certaine and true tokens vnto them: and ſo the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aroſe a great iarre emong them ſelues. But in the end they departed all alike ſatisfied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted: and made this report of her to our holie father the Pope, that they neuer found a ſoule neither ſo humble nor ſo illuminated. Howbeit, when the Pope vnderſtood, how they had ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with her to moue her to choler, he was verie angrie with them: &amp; made his excuſe to her verie effectually, declaring, that it was done without his will or conſent. And he ſaid furthermore, that, if thoſe prelates came anie more to ſpeake with her, they ſhould ſhut the doores againſt them. The next daie doctour <hi>Francis</hi> the Popes phiſicion ſaid theſe wordes vnto me. Knowe you thoſe prelates, that came yeſter daie to our houſe? I made him anſwere, that I knewe them not. Then ſaid he to me. I aſſure you, that, if the knowledge of thoſe three were put in one balance, and the knowledge of all the reſt, that are in the court of Come, were put in the other, the knowledge of theſe three would weigh much more, then all theirs. And therefore I will tell you, that, if they had not found this maid <hi>Caterine</hi> to haue a verie good ground, ſhe had made as ill a voiage at this tyme, as euer ſhe made in her life. And then he commended her with verie great and effectuall wordes: which I omit in this place for breuities ſake. Theſe are
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:8350:175"/> the verie wordes of that bleſſed and holie man father <hi>Steuen:</hi> who was (as it is ſaid) long tyme conuerſant with her, as her ſpirituall ſonne and ſcholer: and afterwardes became a monke and ſo conſequently (for his vertue and holines) a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ouer a couent of Carthuſians neere vnto Pauia. Where, being earneſtly required, he wro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te a ſhort abbridgment of the holie maides life. In the which is conteined (brefely and in effecte) the whole ſubſtance of this booke. For corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration wherof, he cauſed the ſaid abbridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be firmed with the great ſeale of his couent, and to be ſubſigned with the handes of two publike notaries, in the preſence of a great nomber of witneſſes. And made this ſolemne proteſtation withall in as earneſt and vehement termes, as he could deuiſe: that for confirmation of the truth of that whole ſtorie and euerie point conteined in the ſame, to the honour of God and edifying of ſoules, he would be found readie at all tymes to take a corporall oathe, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer fourme it could be moſt exactely deuiſed, and to put his hand, not only to that preſent writing, but alſo into the fyer, if it were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

                  <p>THe holie maid was (as we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heretofore) oftentymes rauiſhed in ſpirite, and vtterly abſtracted from her bodilie ſenſes. At which tymes it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed almightie God to vtter by ſecret inſpiration vnto the ſoule of his deere ſpouſe, diuerſe &amp; ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie pointes of myſticall doctrine. Which ſhe (being ſo rauiſhed and abſtracted) vttered in the preſence of manie godlie and great learned men: which wrote, as ſhe ſpake, and compiled a booke conteinyng ſixe treatiſes. The concluſion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I thought good to laie downe in this place, word for word, as it is written: bicauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth in fewe wordes, an abbridgement or briefe ſomme of all ſuch matters, as are ſet out at large in the whole booke before. The wordes of almightie God to his ſpouſe are theſe. Now moſt deere and welbeloued daughter, I haue ſatisfied thy deſire from the begynnyng of my talke, vnto the laſt, that I had, concernyng obedience: for, if thou be well remembred, thou requiredſt of me with a carefull deſire (as thou knoweſt, I cauſed thee to deſire) that I ſhould make the fyer of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to increaſe in thee. Thou requiredſt, I ſaie, fouer petitions: of the which one was for thy ſelfe. The which I ſatisfied by illuminating thee
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:8350:176"/> with the light of my truth, ſhewing thee, that through the light of faith, with the knowledge of thee and me, by ſuch meanes, as I declared vnto thee, thou cameſt to the knowledge of truth. Thy ſecond petition was, that I ſhould ſhewe mercie to the wordle. Thy third pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was, for the bodie myſticall of my holie Church, beſeeching me, that I ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie from it darckenes and perſecutions, which it ſuffreth at this preſent. And thou requiredſt, that I ſhould puniſh the iniquities of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell vpon thee. Whereupon I declared vnto thee, that no paine, that hath an end, or is geuen in tyme, that hath an end, is able of it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, to ſatisfie for a ſynne done and committed againſt me, which am an endles goodnes. But it maie well ſatiſfie, if it be ioyned with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of hart and deſire of ſowle. The maner alſo, how this ſatisfaction maie be made, I haue declared vnto thee. Then I made thee anſwere, that I will ſhewe mercie to the worlde, ſhewing thee, that it is proper to me to be mercifull. Whereupon for mercies ſake, and for the ineſtimable loue, that I bare to man, I ſent my only begotten Sonne and word. The which thing that I might declare more plainely to thee, I likened him to a bridge, that reacheth from heauen to earth, by reaſon of the vnion, that is made in him, betweene the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of God and man. And, to geue thee yet a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther light of my truth, I ſhewed thee, how the
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:8350:177"/> waie to clymme vp this bridge, is by three ſteppes, to witte, by the three powers of the ſoule. And of this true bridge ſhewed vnto thee, I made a figure in my bodye, reſembling thoſe three ſteppes. (as thou knoweſt verie well) the firſt in my feete, the ſecond in my ſide, and the third in my mouth. In the which I put the three ſtates of the ſoule, to witte, the ſtate imperfecte, the ſtate perfecte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſtate moſt perfecte: in the which the ſoule atteineth fully to the excellencie of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loue. And in each of theſe I ſhewed thee plainely, what thing that is, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth awaie imperfection: and what is the defecte or let of perfection: and by what waie one maie come to it. I ſpake to thee alſo concernyng the ſecret deceites of the deuels, and concernyng ſpirituall ſelfe loue. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more I ſpake to thee in theſe three ſtates, of the reproofes, that my clemencie maketh. The firſt reproofe I put to be made in this life, before they depart out of their bodie. The ſecond at their death; which toucheth them, that die in mortall ſynne. Of whome I told thee, that they went vnder the bridge by the waie of the deuell: and I ſhewed vnto thee of their myſeries. The third reproofe (I ſhewed) ſhould be at the generall iudgement: where I ſhewed thee ſomewhat concernyng the paines of the damned, and glorie of the bleſſed, when euerie one ſhall receiue the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:8350:177"/> dowries of his bodie. In like manner I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed thee, and doe promiſe, that with much ſufferance of my myniſters I will refourme my ſpouſe the Church: inuiting you to ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, complainyng my ſelf with thee of their iniquitie, and ſhewing thee withall, what an excellent place I haue put them in, and what reuerence I doe require, that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſonnes ſhould doe vnto them. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto thee, that my will was, that their reuerence ſhould in no wiſe be diminiſhed for anie defectes or exceſſes, that are in them; and how much it diſpleaſeth me, when the contrarie is done. I ſpake alſo to thee of the vertue of thoſe, that liue like Angels: Where I touched withall, the excellencie and worthnes of the bleſſed Sacrament of the Aulter. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, while I was ſpeaking to thee of the three ſtates of the ſoule, thou wert deſirous to be infourmed concerning the ſtates of teares, and to know, from whence teares pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede. Whervpon I declared the matter or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly vnto thee, ſhewing, that the ſtates of teares haue an accordance with the ſtates of the ſoule, and that all teares doe proceede out of the fountaine of the hart. And of this I aſſigned the cauſe, proceeding orderly. Moreouer I declared, that there were fiue kindes of teares: of the which the fifte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendreth death. Then I made anſwere to thy fouerth requeſt: which was, that I ſhould
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:8350:178"/> prouide for a certaine particular caſe, that had happened: for the which I prouided (as thou knoweſt verie well.) And vpon this I declared vnto thee, of my prouidence both in generall and in ſpeciall, from the begynning of the creation, vntill the end of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Where I ſhewed, how I made and doe make all thinges, with a moſt high and diuine prouidence, geuing or permitting all thinges, to witt, comfortes and tribulations, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall, for your good: that you maie be ſanctified in me, and my truth ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in you. For my truth was and is this, that I haue created you to haue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting: Which truth is opened to you with the blood of the Word. which is my only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Sonne. Laſt of all I ſatisfied thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and diſcharged my promiſe made to thee, by declaring vnto thee and ſpeaking of the perfection of obedience, and of the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of diſobedience: and from whence it cometh, and what thing that is, that taketh obedience from you. And I put it for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall keye: and ſo it is. And I ſpake to thee of the particular: and of the perfecte and imperfecte perſonnes, liuing both in religion and out of religion. Of each of theſe pointes I informed thee plainely and diſtinctly. I ſpake to thee likewiſe of the peace, that obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce geueth; and of the warre, that diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience cauſeth: adding and ſhewing withall,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:8350:178"/> how by the diſobedience of <hi>Adam</hi> death came into the wordle. Now I the euerlaſting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the moſt high and eternall veritie, doe conclude openly, that you doe obteine euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life by the obedience of the Word, to witt, of my only begotten Sonne. And as all men haue taken death and damnation of the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo haue all men, that will beare the keye of obedience, taken life euerlaſting of the newe man <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> my moſt deerely beloued Sonne. Of whome I haue made you a bridge (after the tyme, that the waie of heauen was broken downe) that you maie paſſe without harme by this ſweete and ſtreight waie (which is a cleere and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome truth) with the keye of holeſome obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. And ſo paſſing without harme thorough the darckenes of this preſent life, at the laſt with the keye of my Word you find hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen open vnto you. Now I inuite thee (with the reſt of my frindes and ſeruantes) to weepe. for by weeping and by continuall and humble praier I mynd to ſhewe mercie to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Runne therefore by this waie of truth, that thou be not rebuked afterwardes for going ſlowly, for there ſhalbe more required of thee now, then before: bicauſe I haue ſhewed my ſelfe vnto thee in my truth. And take good heed, that thou neuer goe out of the cell of the knowledge of thy ſelfe: but in this cell keepe and ſpend the treaſure, that I haue
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:8350:179"/> geuen thee: which treaſure is a doctrine of truth, founded vpon the firme and liuely rocke <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> my only begotten Sonne. And this truth is clad with a moſt goodlie and ſhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng light, which diſpatcheth darkenes. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore clad thy ſelfe with truth, my ſweete and moſt deerely beloued daughter.</p>

Thankes be to thee, O eternall Father, bicauſe thou haſt not deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me thy creature: neither haſt thou turned thy face from me, nor made light of my deſires. Thou, being the light, diddeſt not looke to my darckenes. Thou, being life, diddeſt not looke to my death. Thou, being the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, diddeſt not refuſe my grieuous infirmitie. Thou, being the euerlaſting purenes, diddeſt not deſpiſe me, that am full of durt and infinite

But in thy light thou haſt geuen me light: in thy wiſedome I am come to knowe truth: in thy clemencie I haue found the loue of thee, and charitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes my neighbour.

For thou (O eternal Trinitie) art the Creatour, and I the creature. And therefore I knowe by the light, that thou haſt geuen me, in the newe creation, that thou haſt wrought in me by the blood of thy only begotten Sonne, that thou art enamored with the beautie of thy creature. O botomles deapth, O euerlaſting Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, O Godhead, O deepe Sea: what greater thing couldeſt thou geue me, then thyne owne ſelfe? Thou art the fyer, which doſt euer burne, and neuer waſte. Thou art the fyer, which doſt conſume with thy heate all ſelfe loue in a ſoule. Thou art the fyer, which takeſt awaie all cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and doſt illuminate myndes with thy light: with the which light thou haſt made me to knowe thy truth. Thou art that light aboue all light, which geueſt a ſupernatural light to the eye of our vnderſtanding in ſuch perfection and aboundance, that euen the light of faith is made more cleere by it. In the which faith I ſee, that my ſoule hath life: and in this light it receiueth thee that art the light; For in the light of faith I get wiſedome, in the wiſedome of the word
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:8350:181"/> thy So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne. In this light of faith I am made ſtrong, and conſtant, and able to hold out. In this light of faith I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue a hope, that thou wilt not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to faint in the waie. This light teacheth me the waie, by the which I muſt walke: and without this light I ſhould walke in darckenes. And therefore I made my petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to thee, O eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Father, that thou wouldeſt illuminate me with the light of this moſt holie faith. Truly this light is a ſea, which doth feede the ſoule in thee the quiet and calme ſea, vntill it be wholly in thee. O calme ſea, euerlaſting Trinitie. The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this ſea is not troubled, and therefore it cauſeth no feare, but geueth the knowledge of truth. This is a moſt cleere water, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thinges hidden. And therefore where this moſt goodlie ſhyning light of thy faith aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, there is the ſoule as it were clarified and made bright by the thing that it beleeueth. This is a ſecond glaſſe, which thou (ô euerlaſting Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie) doſt make me to knowe. The which, being holden with the hand of loue before the eyes of my ſoule, represe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth to me my ſelfe in thee, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, that I am thy creature.

Wherefore ô euerlaſting Trinitie, in the light, that thou haſt geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, &amp; I haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by the meanes of this light of thy moſt holie faith (thyne owne ſelfe ſhewi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the ſame vnto me by diuerſe &amp; ſundrie wonderful declarations) I am come to knowe the waie of great perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to the end that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this tyme foreward I ſhould ſerue thee with light &amp; not with darckenes, and be a glaſſe of a good and holie life, and ſo raiſe my ſelfe vp from this miſerable life, in the which I haue hitherto ſerued thee euermore in darcke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: for I knewe not thy truth, and therefore I loued it not. But wherefore did I not knowe thee? Forſooth, becauſe I ſawe thee not. And wherefore did I not ſee thee with the light of this moſt holie and glorious faith? Becauſe the myſt of ſelfe loue had dymmed the eye of myne vnderſtanding. But thou (O eternal truth) haſt with thy light diſſolued my darckenes. And who ſhalbe able to reach to thy heyght, and yeald thee thanckes for this paſsing great gyfte, and for the manifold and large benefites, that thou haſt beſtowed vpon me, and for the doctrine of truth, that thou haſt reuealed vnto

Treating on a tyme with Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the eleuenth, concernyng the troubles and turmoiles, that were then in the Church, and how the ſame might beſt be quieted, ſhe was not afraid to tell him his duetie in plaine termes, and to aduertiſe him in Gods behalfe, how he ought to rule and feed his flocke. Emong a nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of particular informations and exhortations, that ſhe made vnto the Popes holines at that tyme, ſhe ſpake theſe wordes in the preſence of diuerſe and ſundrie of his Cardinals and other Prelates. Come, ſaid ſhe, againſt theſe falſe and rebellious children with the meekenes of the Croſſe, and not with the furie of the ſwoord: and ſo ſhall you ſee, that theſe wolues ſhall laie downe their heads in your lappes, and humbly ſubmit them ſelues vnto you.

<pb n="369" facs="tcp:8350:183"/> malicious enterpriſe, and loth to heare anie thing to the contrarie, will not ſticke to make you out of the waie, in caſe they ſee, that you are like to preuaile, or doe anie good in the matter. When the holie maid heard that, ſhe cried out with a great feruour and vehemencie of ſpirite, &amp; ſaid. If S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> S. <hi>Margaret,</hi> and other holie Virgins had caſt ſuch perils, they had neuer worne thoſe glorious crownes of martyrdome, that they now weare in heauen. Alas father, why ſaie you ſo? Haue not we our Spouſe to accompanie vs alſo, euen as they had? And is not he able to defend our bodies and liues from all villanie, that ſhall or maie be offred vnto vs by a no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of baſe and abiecte men? Surely, ſurely father, theſe feareful cogitations are but vaine, and do proceede rather of a weake faith and lacke of affiance in almightie God, then of true wiſedome. At theſe wordes Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> was ſo ſtriken, that, he held his peace and gaue her not one word to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere; For being her Confeſſour, and thereby vnderſtanding perfectly the ſtate of her ſoule, he knewe right well, that ſuch wordes in her came not of anie inordinate heat or paſsion of the mynd, but only of a verie perfecte and pure zeale, that ſhe had, to the honour of God, and aduancement of his Church. The reformation of the which ſhe ſo much te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, that manie tymes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe made hir praiers vnto God for the ſame, ſhe would beſeech him in moſt hartie maner, that ſhe might die for it in extremitie of paines
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:8350:184"/> and tormentes, and that ſhe might afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des be reſtored to life againe, and ſo die againe and againe, ſo oftentymes as ſhould be thought ſufficient for the obteyning of that bleſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, that ſhe ſo earneſtly longed after. Verie manie tymes, being in praier, ſhe would vtter theſe wordes with a paſsing great feruour of ſpirite. O Lord, let all the partes of my bodie, all my bones, all the marowe within my bones be beaten and pounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in a morter: only reſtore thy holie Church againe to her comelines and beautie. And though the whole ſtate of her life were in deed a verie martyrdome, yet had ſhe ſuch a longyng and impatient deſire to ſhead her blood for the loue ſhe bare to Chriſt and his Church, that all her wordes and deedes ſeemed after a ſort to tend to it: as it maie appeere by a letter, that ſhe wrote to Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng the ſame matter. In the which it is to be ſeene, what a paſsing delite ſhe tooke in iterating theſe wordes againe and againe: blood, blood: Ieſus, Ieſus.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <head>Chap. 22.</head>
                  <p>WHen the holie maid vnderſtood by reuelation from God, that her tyme drewe neere, in the which ſhe ſhould paſſe out of this wordle: ſhe called all her ſpiritual children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her both men and women, and to them all in general ſhe made a meruelous godlie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſermon, exhorting them to goe forward conſtantly in their purpoſed waie of vertue, vntill they came to the perfection of the ſame. And in this ſermon ſhe expreſſed manie nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pointes of doctrine, which I thought good to touch briefely in this place, for the direction of all ſuch, as mind to walke perfectly, and not to erre in the ſtreight patthes of a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life. The firſt and moſt principal point of her doctrine, &amp; (as it were) the ground-worke of all her exhortation, was this. To a man, that cometh vnfeinedly to the ſeruice of God, and myndeth in deed to poſſeſſe God perfectly, it is neceſſarie, that he do vtterly ſpoile his hart, and make it naked and bare of all ſenſible loue, not only of all perſones, but alſo of all creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, whatſoeuer they be: and being ſo ſpoiled, that he do earneſtly bend him ſelfe towardes God his Creatour with a ſingle and whole hart;
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:8350:185"/> For the hart (ſaid ſhe) can not be wholly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vp to God, vnleſſe it be free from all other loue, and withal open and ſimple without all doublenes. And ſhe declared vnto them, that her principal labour &amp; ſtudie euen from her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to her dying daie had ben, to atteine to the perfection of this point.</p>
                  <p>Item ſhe ſaid, that no man can poſsibly come to ſuch ſtate of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as to be able to offer vp his hart to God freely and wholly, without anie let or encombrance, vnleſſe he ſeeke it at Gods hand by praier. And ſhe ſaid withal, that it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required in praier, that it be grounded vpon humilitie; and that the man, that myndeth to obteine anie thing by praier, muſt haue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence in anie vertue or merite of his owne, but only in the goodnes of God, reputing him ſelfe as nothing in the ſight of God. And ſhe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded furthermore, that ſhe had ben alwaies care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent to geue her ſelfe to praier, that ſhe might haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual habite of the ſame: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſawe, that of praier all vertues receiue their increaſe &amp; ſtrength, as contrariwiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out praier all vertues decaie &amp; fall quite awaie. And for this cauſe ſhe exhorted them to geue them ſelues earneſtly &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of praier. And here ſhe declared vnto them, that there were two kindes of praier, the one called vocal, the other mental: &amp; that theſe two kindes were to be vſed, the one at tymes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in ſaying or ſingyng the Canonical howers and Church-ſeruice, the other at all tymes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:8350:185"/> in acte, ſo long as it might be done with diſcretion, or els in will and deſire, when it might no longer be continued actually.</p>
                  <p>Item ſhe ſaid, that ſhe ſawe cleerely by the light of a liuely faith, that, whatſoeuer happened to her ſelfe or others in this life, came all from God, not of anie hatred, that he had to anie, but of a paſsing great loue, that he bare to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And thereof ſhe conceiued a certaine loue and readines to obey the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundments both of God and alſo of her ſuperiours: ſo taking their commaundments, as though they had come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the mouth of God, either for the neceſsitie of her ſaluation, or els for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of vertue in her ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Item ſhe ſaid, that, whoſoeuer is deſirous to come to a cleane and pure ſtate of mynd, muſt of neceſsitie refraine him ſelfe from all iudging of others, and from ſpeaking vainely of the doings of others, and looke only to the will of God in all his creatures, which doth or permitteth all thinges to a good end. And for this cauſe ſhe charged them verie effectually, that they ſhould neuer iudge anie perſon, that is, they ſhould not by waie of iudgement deſpiſe or condemne anie perſone, though they ſawe euidently with their eyes ſome ſynne committed: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if the ſynne were manifeſt, they ſhould haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſsion on the partie, that had offended, &amp; praie to God for his amendment. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng this point ſhe added thus much (not as of her ſelf, but as a moſt vndoubted truth receiued
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:8350:186"/> at Gods owne mouth) that manie perſones, for not obſeruing this precept, had failed of their final intended perfection in ſpiritual life, which otherwiſe, for a nomber of excellent vertues, that were in them, might haue prooued great Sainctes.</p>
                  <p>Item ſhe ſaid, that ſhe had alwaies repoſed a verie great hope and affiance in the prouidence of God, and ſo ſhe exhorted them to doe: affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng, that ſhe had tried by experience, that the prouidence of God was paſsing great, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer failed them, that put their truſt in him. The which thing both ſhe and manie other, that kept her companie, had ſeene verified oftentymes by verie certaine and euident miracles.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and manie other goodlie pointes of doctrine ſhe vttered vnto them: and in the end ſhe concluded her long exhortation with that precept of our Sauiour Chriſt, exhorting them verie humbly and withal verie earneſtly, that they ſhould loue one an other. My deere chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (ſaid ſhe) loue one an other. This ſaying ſhe repeated againe and againe after a merue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſweet and louelie maner: and did, what ſhe could, to make them to vnderſtand, that ſhe ſpake thoſe wordes of a verie inward affection and great feruour of ſpirite, to the end that they ſhould the better beare them awaie, and imprint them the deeper in their hartes. My deere children (ſaid ſhe) loue one an other truly and ſyncerely: for by this you ſhall ſhewe, that
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:8350:186"/> you are willing to be my children, and by this I ſhall take my ſelfe to be your mother. If you loue one an other, you ſhall be my crowne and glorie before God, and I will acknowledge you before him to be my true children, and I wilbe a continual interceſſour to his diuine Maieſtie for you, that as he hath voutchſafed to endue my ſoule abundantly with his grace, ſo he will alſo powre the like abundance of grace into your ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all ſhe commaunded them (after a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine charitable maner) that they ſhould keepe their deſires euermore feruent and burnyng, and that they ſhould offer vp the ſame before God for the reformation and good ſtate of the Church of God, and of his vicare the Pope: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming of her ſelfe, that ſhe had alwaies kept her hart and deſires in ſuch a feruour (eſpecially for the ſpace of ſeuen yeares before that tyme) and that ſhe had neuer omitted (ſpecially in thoſe ſeuen yeares) to offer vp her hart and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires in ſuch ſort before the diuine Maieſtie of almightie God. And ſhe confeſſed plainely, that, for the obteinyng of this grace at Gods hand, ſhe had ſuſteined manie grieuous paines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in her bodie, and that ſhe did at that verie preſent ſuſteine meruelous great and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paines for the ſame cauſe. And ſhe added furthermore, that as almightie God had geuen licence to Satan to torment the bodie of <hi>Iob,</hi> ſo it ſeemed alſo, that he had graunted him power
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:8350:187"/> to torment and vexe her bodie in ſuch ſort, that from the ſole of her foote to the top of her head there was no one part without his peculiar paine &amp; torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in her. And as no part was void of his proper paine, ſo manie partes were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with diuerſe &amp; su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drie paines together: as it was ſenſibly perceiued of as manie, as ſtood by her at that tyme, &amp; ſaw her in that great agonie.</p>
                  <p>After that ſhe had thus ended her ſermon or exhortation, she ſpake to them after a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar maner, and ſaid. My right deere and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely beloued, I now ſee cleerely, that my moſt louing ſpouſe hath ſo diſpoſed of me, that, when my bodie hath indured ſuch tormentes and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as his B. goodnes hath graunted me, my ſoule, continuing ſtill in theſe veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, fyerie, &amp; howeful deſires, shall in that ſtate be deliuered out of this darcke priſon, &amp; ſo returne againe to his firſt original &amp; begynning. Thoſe, that ſtood about her, were meruelouſly aſtonied to ſee her patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; cheerefulnes in all her paines: Which, they ſawe by verie euident toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, were ſo great &amp; veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that, they thought it impoſsible for her or anie other creature to beare them, as she did (without shewing ſo much as anie litle ſigue of ſorrowe or lamentation) but that she was ſtaied by ſome verie great &amp; ſpecial grace of God. And as they wondered as her patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo did they make great ſorrowe and wept verie pitifully, to ſee their good mother in ſuch tormentes. The which when ſhe perceiued, ſhe ſpake to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:8350:187"/> after a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable maner, and ſaid. There is no cauſe, my deere children, whie you ſhould be ſorie to ſee me in theſe paines: conſidering, that theſe paines are the meane to bring me to death, &amp; by death to a better life. But you ought rather, to reioyce with me: to thinke, that I shall now leaue this troubleſome place of paine, and goe to reſt in God that cleere &amp; calme ſea. Be of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort: for I promiſe you faithfully, that I will ſtand you in better ſteed after my paſſage from hence, then euer I did or might doe, ſo long as I was in this darcke life full of miſeries. True it is; that I do put my life, my death, &amp; all, in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of my deere and euerlaſting ſpouſe. If he ſhall thinke it expedient for anie creature of his, that I tarrie here ſtill in labour and paine, I am right well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted &amp; glad (for the honour of his name &amp; edifying of my neighbour) to ſuffer, if it were poſsible, a hundred deathes and martyrdoms in a daie. But if it be his will &amp; pleaſure, that I ſhall paſſe at this time, and in theſe tormentes, be you well aſſured, that I haue at the length with long and inſtant ſute obteined at his hand a verie ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial grace, which is, that it would pleaſe him to accept my bodie, as a ſacrifice and burnt offring for the reformation of his Church.</p>
                  <p>After this ſhe called the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto her one by one, and gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in charge, what order of life euerie one ſhould take after her deceaſe. Some ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to liue in religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſome to be Heremites, and ſome to be ſecular Prieſtes. Ouer the ſiſters
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:8350:188"/> of Penance ſhe appointed <hi>Alexia</hi> to be mother. And ſhe willed them all to haue recourſe to Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> after her death, euen as they had had to her in her life tyme, and to vſe his direction in all matters. When ſhe had thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed of all thinges particularly by the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the holie Ghoſt, which vndoubtedly ſpake in her at that tyme (as it was euidently ſeene afterwardes by the goodlie and bleſſed ſucceſſe of all ſuch thinges, as ſhe tooke ſpecial order for in that extremitie) ſhe asked them all forgeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and ſaid. Decrely beloued, though I haue ben alwaies verie deſirous of your ſoules health (which thing in deed I can not denie) yet I know well, that I haue failed in manie pointes: both becauſe I haue not ben to you ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect paterne of ſpiritual light, vertue, and good woorkes, as a true handmaid and Spouſe of Chriſt might haue ben: and alſo becauſe I haue not ben ſo diligent and careful about your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie neceſsities, as I ought to haue ben. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I moſt humbly and inſtantly beſeech you all, and euerie one of you, to pardon me: and I exhort you all to hold out in the waie of vertue vntill the end: for in ſo doing (as I ſaid) you ſhalbe my ioye and crowne before God. With that ſhe ceaſed of her exhortation to them, and called for her ghoſtlie Father, and to him made a general Confeſsion of her whole life: and ſo receiued the bleſſed Sacrament with meruelous great deuotion. That done, ſhe required the reſt
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:8350:188"/> of the Sacramentes: which were likewiſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto her in due order and tyme: Laſt of all, ſhe demaunded a full remiſsion or Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that was graunted her before by two Popes, to wite, by Pope <hi>Gregorie,</hi> and Pope <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After that ſhe had thus prepared her ſelfe, ſhe drewe on faſt towardes her end: and being in a verie paineful and vehement fitte, it was well perceiued by her wordes and outward geſtures, that ſhe ſuſteined a meruelous ſharpe &amp; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conflicte with the ghoſtlie enemie; For ſometymes ſhe held her peace, and ſometymes ſhe made anſwere, as it were, to ſome demaund. Sometymes ſhe ſmyled, as though ſhe had ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his reaſons: and ſometymes ſhe roſe in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Emong other thinges, one word ſhe ſpake, which was noted of as manie, as were preſent; And ſurelie it maie well be thought, that it was the will of God, that ſhe ſhould vtter it. When ſhe had held her peace a pretie while, at the length, ſetting a pleaſant countenance vpon it, ſhe made anſwere, as it were, to ſome ſlaunder, that the enemie charged her withal, ſaying. Vaine glorie? Neuer: but only the true glorie and honour of God. Which wordes were not ſpoken without a ſpecial prouidence of God, to remoue a ſiniſter opinion conceiued of her, not only in the wordle, but alſo in manie deuout and ſpiritual perſones, who, ſeeing her paſsing ſweet and charitable demeanour towardes all
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:8350:189"/> kindes of men, and withal, how readie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous ſhe was, not only to receiue, exhort, and comfort all ſuch, as reſorted to her at home, but alſo to trauaile into farre and ſtrange countreis, to extend her charitie to as manie, as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, doubted ſomewhat, that in theſe thinges ſhe might either ſeeke the praiſe of men, or at the leaſt take ſome delite in it, when ſhe heard her ſelfe prayſed. But Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> who being her ghoſtlie Father heard her Confeſsion both general and ſpecial oftentymes, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of all her doinges with great warines and aduiſement, gaue her this teſtimonie with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proteſtation, that he iudged verily and tooke it vpon his conſcience, that, whatſoeuer ſhe did in that kind, ſhe did it by ſpecial inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and commaundment from God, and that ſhe did not ſo much as thinke, either vpon the praiſes of men, or vpon the men them ſelues, but only, when ſhe praied to God for them, or did ſome other charitable woorke to the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of their ſoules.</p>
                  <p>But now, to come to our matter againe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holie maid had thus fought a long combat with the ghoſtlie enemie, and had in the end through the grace and aſsiſtance of God obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a full and final victorie ouer him, comyng to her ſelfe againe, ſhe made a general Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, not Sacramentally, but openly, ſaying <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteor</hi> (as the maner is) and ſo required the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral abſolution to be likewiſe pronounced ouer
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:8350:189"/> her. That done, it was ſenſibly perceiued, that all the powers of her bodie decaied foorthwith by litle and litle. The which notwithſtanding ſhe ceaſed not to exhort and ſpeake comfortable wordes, not only to them, that were there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her, but alſo to other, that were abſent. Emong others, ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe to haue a verie ſpecial remembrance and care of Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> vnto whom ſhe willed them all to haue recourſe in all their doubtes and diſtreſſes for ſpiritual counſel. Commend me to him, ſaid ſhe, and bid him to be of good comfort, and not to faint or feare, whatſoeuer betide; For I will be with him, and will from tyme to tyme deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him from all dangers. And if he chaunce at anie tyme to doe otherwiſe, then he ſhould doe, I will geue him diſcipline. Theſe wordes ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated againe and againe, vntill her ſpeach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at the length to faile her. Laſt of all, when the verie throwes of death came vpon her, ſhe ſaid theſe wordes. <hi>Lord, into thy handes I commend my ſpirite.</hi> And with that ſhe gaue vp the Ghoſt, in the yeare of her age. 33. of our Lord. 1380. the 29. daie of April (which as then was ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daie, and the feaſt of S. <hi>Peter</hi> the Martyr) about eight of the clocke before noone.</p>

Doctor <hi>Raimundus</hi> hearing or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing thoſe wordes, (in deed more liuely expreſſed to this mynd, then if they had ben pronounced by the voice of anie man) was much aſtoined, and began to caſt with him ſelfe, what maner of comfort and warrant of ſecuritie that might be, and from whence he might thinke, that it came. And, bicauſe he was then doing a litle worke in the honour of our bleſſed Ladie, he began to thinke, whether it might not be ſhe, that had geuen him thoſe comfortable wordes. Howbeit, conſidering
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:8350:192"/> his owne vnworthines, he durſt not preſume ſo much. Then it came to his mynd, that there might be ſome great trouble towardes him: for the which cauſe he praied to our bleſſed Ladie the mother of mercie (whome he knewe to be a ſpecial comforter of all afflicted perſones) that ſhe would vouchſafe, by that her comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table promiſe, to make him more warie, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunſpecte, and readie to beare whatſoeuer it ſhould pleaſed God to laie vpon him. And there was ſome cauſe alſo whie he might ſuſpecte ſuch troubles the more, bicauſe he had at that tyme preached againſt certaine ſciſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, that were in the citie: of whome he ſtood in ſome doubt, that they would haue ſet for him, to doe ſome miſchiefe to him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine, as they ſhould paſſe betweene Genua &amp; Piſa. And ſo at that tyme he could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, what that voice ſhould be, what it ſhould meane, or whence it ſhould come. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, when he came to Tuſcan and heard them there tell of the tyme and maner of the holie maides departure, he called this ſtrange voice to mynd againe, and ſawe by the compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the tyme, that theſe wordes were ſpoken to him at that verie hower, when the holie maid paſſed out of this wordle to God. Wherefore he gaue moſt hartie thankes, both to our Lord, and alſo to his bleſſed ſpouſe S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> for the great grace and comfort, that they had vouchſafed to ſend him.</p>

                  <head>Chap. 2.</head>
                  <p>IT was reuealed to the holie maid (as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſecretiy to doct: <hi>Raimundus</hi> &amp; to doct: <hi>Thomas</hi> her confeſſour alſo) that in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen ſhe ſhould haue the bleſſed vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin S. <hi>Agnes</hi> of mount Politian for her compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and be placed there in equal degree with her. Wherupon ſhe bare a verie ſpecial deuotion to S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> and therefore beſought her confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours, that they would geue her licence to goe thither in pilgrimage, with ſome other of her ſiſters, to viſite the holie relikes. Which requeſt they graunted with a good will, and went them ſelues alſo with her, to ſee, if almightie God would ſhewe anie token of his determination, concernyng the afore promiſed felowſhip that ſhould be betweene theſe two holie virgins. When the holie maide came to the monaſterie, ſhe went foorthwith, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compained with the ſiſters of her owne retinue, and moſt of the Nonnes of the ſame monaſterie alſo) to the place, where S. <hi>Agnes</hi> bodie laie all whole and vnperiſhed, euen as it was the firſt daie that it was laid there. And comyng to the holie ſhryne, ſhe kneeled downe vpon the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:8350:193"/> and bowed her head with great reuerence and deuotion to kiſſe the feete. But the dead bodie of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> as it were refuſing that honour of her companion, lifted vp one foote in the preſence of them al ſo high, that ſhe might haue kiſſed it without bowing downe either bodie or head. The which thing when the holie maid ſawe, ſhe humbled her ſelfe the more, &amp; ſtooped downe with greater reuerence. And ſo <hi>S. Agnes</hi> bodie drewe her legge downe againe, and ſet it, as it was before. This miracle it pleaſed almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God to worke at that tyme to the honour of thoſe two bleſſed virgins, in the preſence of all the aforeſaid ſiſters of penance, and Nonnes of the ſame monaſterie. And yet there lacked not ſome one or two emong them, that did (what in them laie) to depraue the maner of the miracle. Which turned in the end by the diſpoſition of God, to the further ſetting out of the ſame; For the next daie, when doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> with the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie came thither (which by occaſion had ſtaied behind) hearing by the common brute what a ſtrange worke had ben wrought there to the honour of God and of the two bleſſed virgins, and vnderſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, that there was one or two euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed women amonge them, that wente about to diſcredit the matter, ſayinge, that the holie mayde had done it by art magicke, or otherwiſe by ſome ſleyghte of the deuill,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:8350:194"/> he called the whole couent of Nonnes together before him, by vertu of a commiſſion graunted to him by the General of that prouince, and charged them all in the vertu of of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they ſhould declare, what they had ſeene: proteſting to them, that his deſire was, to vnderſtand the verie truth of the matter to the glorie of God, and no more nor no leſſe, but only the verie bare truth. They made hin anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were one by one, and declared ſo much as hath ben declared here before. Then he called one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before him, that laboured to impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the truth of the miracle, and aſked her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the matter had paſſed in ſuch ſort, as the reſt had depoſed. And ſhe confeſſed plainely before them all, that it was euen ſo, as they had ſaid. But (ſaid ſhe) S. <hi>Agnes</hi> did not worke that miracle to anie ſuch end, as you imagin. To that doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> made anſwere and ſaid. Deerely beloued ſiſter, we aſke not you, what the meaning of S. <hi>Agnes</hi> was, bicauſe we knowe, that you are neither hir ſecretarie nor yet of her counſel. But we aſke of you only, whether you ſawe that lifting vp of the foote, and taking of it downe againe in ſuch ſort, as the reſt of your ſiſters haue declared. Yea, ſaid ſhe: that can not be denied. When doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> had thus put her to ſome ſhame before the whole couent, he enioyned her ſuch penance for her offence as the order of their diſcipline required, and he thought moſt expedient for the example
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:8350:194"/> of others. An other tyme the holie maid comyng to the monaſterie againe, to place two of her brothers daughters there in the ſeruice of God, the firſt thing that ſhe did, ſhe went to viſite the holie reliques of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> as ſhe had done before, And there went with her certaine of her owne compaine, and certaine of the Nonnes of the ſame monaſterie. When ſhe came to the place, ſhe ſet her ſelfe downe, not as ſhe had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at the feete, but at the head, with great ioye and cheerefulnes, and put her cheeke to the cheeke of S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> which was couered with a veile of ſilke, and there held it a good while. After that ſhe had continued ſo a good long ſpace, at the length ſhe turned her ſelfe ſodainly backe, and ſpake to the ſiſters, that were there preſent, and namely to her coſen <hi>Liſa,</hi> after a meruelous ioyful and humble maner, ſaying. Whie do you not conſider of this great gyfte of God, that is ſent vs here from heauen: VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore are you ſo vngrateful? VVith that <hi>Liſa</hi> and the reſt held vp their heades, and behold, they ſawe a certaine Manna, to wite a verie white and ſmall graine, to come downe from heauen, and to couer the bodies of thoſe two bleſſed virgins. And this Manna fell in ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, that <hi>Liſa</hi> filled both her handes of it, and kept it afterwardes for a relike and monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for comfirmation of the truth of this great miracle. The like chaunced to the holie virgin S. <hi>Agnes</hi> oftentymes in her life tyme, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely

When the bleſſed virgin S. <hi>Agnes</hi> ſhould be borne into the wordle, there were a nomber of goodlie lights ſeene in the place, where her mother trauailed, lighted by the almightie power of God, without anie helpe of man: which continued and yealded a meruelous confortable light to as manie, as were there preſent, vntill ſuch time, as the babe was fully borne, and then ceaſed. By the which our Lord would foreſhewe, what a goodlie and ſingular light of diuerſe and ſundrie vertues ſhe ſhould geue in tyme to come to the wordle. In her life tyme, as ſhe grewe in yeares, ſo did ſhe likewiſe increaſe in all kinde of vertue, in humilitie, patience, contempte of the wordle, and feruour towardes religion. The which ſtate of life ſhe tendred ſo much, that he buylded two monaſteries of Nonnes: and in the later of the two, ſhe liued a holie life, and died a bleſſed death: where it pleaſed God to worke manie greate and ſtraunge miracles by her in her life time, and many moe after her death. Emonge other, this was, and is one, that her bodie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth ſtill whole and vnputrified, euen as it was at the verie hower of her departure. When
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:8350:196"/> ſhe was newly dead, the people in regard of the wonderful ſignes, that ſhe had wrought emong them in her life, thought to haue preſerued her bodie with baulme. But when they came to the bodie, they ſawe that it was needles: forſomuch as there diſtilled a verie ſweet and precious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qour out at the endes of her fingers &amp; toes, that paſſed all baulme; which was diligently gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by them, and put in a viole: in the which it is kept to this daie, and at tymes ſhewed to the people for a perpetual remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of this great miracle. The night that ſhe died, the yong ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, that laie in bed with their fathers and mothers, cried out and ſaid. Siſter <hi>Agnes</hi> is now departed: and ſhe is a Saincte in heauen. And the next mornyng a great companie of yong children by the inſtincte of God gathered them ſelues together (and would admit none into their companie, that was not a maid) and ſet them ſelues in order after the maner of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and ſo went with candels burnyng in their handes to the monaſterie, where they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred them vp at the bodie of the bleſſed virgin, euen as we are wont to doe at the monumentes of Sainctes. Theſe and manie other miracles were wrought by almightie God in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of S. <hi>Agnes:</hi> which cauſed the people of the country to haue her relikes in great price and reuerence.</p>

                  <head>Chp. 3.</head>
                  <p>ABout the yeare of our Lord 1373. ther was a great plague in the citie of Sie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: of the which manie men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of all condicions and ages died verie ſoone, after they were once taken; ſome within one daie, ſome within two, and fewe or none paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the third daie: which mortalitie cauſed a great terrour emong the people. Doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> chaunced to be in the citie, at that tyme, reader of the diuinitie leſſon in his couent: who, being a charitable man, &amp; tendring more the health of ſoules, then the preſeruation of his owne bodie, (as his profeſſion and rule requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) he tooke great paines, and went by daie and by night to the houſes, where he might vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand anie to be ſicke, to viſite, comfort, and counſel them for their ſoules health. And manie tymes when he was weerie of runnyng thus to and fro, he vſed to turne a litle aſide into an houſe or hoſpital called, <hi>Our ladie of mercie,</hi> and there to repoſe him ſelfe a while, partly for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recreation both of bodie and ſoule, and partly alſo to ſpeake with Maiſter <hi>Matthewe</hi> the rectour of the ſaid houſe: whome he loued entierly for vertues ſake, and reſorted vnto him commonly once in the daie (and ſo did the holie maid alſo verie often) ſometymes to conferre with him of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:8350:197"/> ſpiritual matters, and ſometymes to aſke either his aduiſe or charitie towardes the reliefe of the poore. On a daie doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> going to viſite the ſicke after his accuſtomed maner, and paſſing by the gate of this houſe, went familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſee, how Maiſter <hi>Matthewe</hi> did with the reſt of his family. When he was entred, he ſaw the bretheren and clearkes buſilie occupied in carying Maiſter <hi>Matthew</hi> from the Church tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardes his chamber: With that he asked him che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully, how he did. But Maiſter <hi>Matthew</hi> was ſo feeble and ſo farre ſpent, that he could not giue him one word to anſwere. Then he aſked them that were about him, how that ſicknes came to him. And they made anſwere, that he had wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched that night with one that was ſicke of the plague, and about midnight tooke the ſicknes of him: ſince the which time, ſaid they, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained (as yee ſee) without coloure, without ſtrength, without ſpirit. When they had brou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght him to his chamber, they laide him downe vopn his bedde. VVhere when he had reſted a litle while, he came to him ſelfe againe, &amp; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> and made his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to him, as he was wont often times to doe. That done doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> ſpake to him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablie. M. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſaid he, how feele yee your ſelfe? where is your paine? My griefe, ſaid he, is in my flancke, and it paineth me ſo ſore, that, me thinketh, my thighe is ready to breake in ſunder. And <hi>I</hi> haue withal ſuch a vehement
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:8350:198"/> headache, that it ſeemeth, as though my head would cleaue in fower partes. With that he felt his pulſes, and fownd in deed, that he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſharpe feuer. Wherupon he cauſed them to carrie his vrine to a learned phiſicion, that was in the citie, called maiſter <hi>Senſus;</hi> and ſoone after went him ſelfe to vnderſtand his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and aduiſe in the matter. When he came, the phiſicion declared vnto him, that he ſawe in the water, verie euident tokens of an ague peſtilential, and alſo of death neere at hand: for, ſaid he, this water ſheweth plainely to me, certaine bubling or boiling of the blood out of the liuer: which is the common diſeaſe, that reigneth now ouer all the citie. Wherefore I am verie ſorie, for I ſee, we are like to leeſe a verie deere frend, and they of his howſe a verie good rectour. What, ſaid doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> is it not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible by your art, to deuiſe ſome kind of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decine, that maie doe him good? We will ſee to morrowe, ſaid he, whether we can purge that blood with <hi>Caſsia Fistula:</hi> but, (to tell you truely) I haue ſmall hope of doing anie good. The diſeaſe is to farre gone. When doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> heard thoſe vncomfortable wordes, he returned towardes the ſicke man againe with a heauie hart. In this meane tyme it came to the eares of the holie maid, that maiſter <hi>Matthewe</hi> was dangerouſly ſicke, and of the plague. When ſhe heard that, ſhe was troubled in ſpirite, as
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:8350:198"/> it were againſt that euel (for ſhe knewe him to be a verie vertuous man, and therefore loued him verie entierly) and forthwith went in great haſt towardes his howſe. And before ſhe came at him, ſhe cried out with a lowd voice ſaying. Maiſter <hi>Matthewe</hi> riſe, riſe vp maiſter <hi>Matthewe.</hi> It is no tyme to lie now ſluggyng in your bed. At that word, and at that verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, the paine in his ſlancke and headache, and the whole diſeaſe forſooke him quite, and he roſe vp as merrie and as ſound in all his bodie, as if there had neuer ben anie ſuch diſeaſe vpon him. And when he was readie, he honoured the the holie maid, and gaue her moſt humble thankes, ſaying, that he knewe now by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in his owne bodie, that the power of God dwelled in her, and wrought ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge thinges by her. But ſhe might not abide to heare anie wordes, that tended to her owne commendation, and therefore ſhe went awaie. As ſhe was going out, doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> came towardes the howſe, and met with her in the gate, looking verie heauily of the matter: (for he knewe nothing of all this, that was done in the howſe, but came directly from the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. When he ſawe her there, being as it were ouercome with ſorrowe he ſaid to her. O mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will you ſuffer this good man, that is ſoe deere to vs, ſo profitable and neceſſarie to mà<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others, to die after this ſorte? To that ſhee made anſwere verie humblie, ſhewing in deed,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:8350:199"/> that ſhe had no liking in ſuch wordes. O Father ſaid ſhee, what maner of talke is this, that you vſe to mee? Take yee me to be a God that you would haue me to deliuer a mortall man from death? I pray you, ſaid he, ſpeake theſe wordes to ſome other, that is a ſtranger to you, and not to me, that knowe your ſecretes. I knowe right well, that, whatſoeuer you aſke of God hartely, he will grant it you. With that ſhe bowed dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne her head a litle, &amp; ſmyled: and after a tyme, looking vp to him againe cheerefully, ſhe ſaid theſe wordes. Father, be of good cheere: for he ſhall not die at this tyme. VVhen doctour, <hi>Raimundus</hi> heard thoſe wordes, he was a glad man, for he knewe well, what grace and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue was geuen to her from aboue. And ſo he went into the houſe to comfort his frind, not knowing in deed, that he had no need of it, but ſuppoſing, that the thing had ben yet to do, that was alreadie done. VVhen he came in, he found him ſitting vp in good health and liking, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto them, that were about him, the maner of the miracle, that was wrought vpon him ſelfe. For the further confirmation wherof, the table was laid, and they eate together that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, not ſuch meates, as ſicke men vſe to eate, but rawe oynions and ſuch other groſſe meates, as can not be digeſted, but only in whole ſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. And as they were eating, they tooke great pleaſure to recite the wonderful thinges, that it pleaſed God to worke by the holie maid. In the
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:8350:199"/> tyme, while this contagious diſeaſe reyned in Siena, it chaunced a certaine Hermite called <hi>Sanctus,</hi> that liued in an Hermitage a litle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the citie, to be infected with the ſame. The which thing when the holie maid vnderſtood, ſhe cauſed him to be taken out of his cell, and brought to this afore mentioned hoſpital of our Ladie of mercie. VVhere ſhe came to him with certaine other of her ſiſters, &amp; tended him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding for him, all ſuch thinges, as ſhe thought neceſſarie or requiſite for a man in that caſe. And to comfort him with wordes alſo, ſhe put her head to his, and whiſpered him ſoftely in the eare, ſaying. Be not afraid, howſoeuer yee feele your ſelfe: for yee ſhall not dye at this tyme. But to the reſt that were there, ſhe ſaid no ſuch thing but rather, when they entreated her, that ſhe would praie to God for his recouerie, ſhe gaue them but an vncomfortable anſwere: which made them verie ſad, for they all knewe him to be a holie man, and therfore both honoured and loued him verie tenderly. The diſeaſe increaſed howerly more and more, and he decayed ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, that they, diſpairing his life, gaue ouer the charge of his body, and looked only to the health of his ſoule. At the length, when he was in extreames, &amp; they all ſtoode about him with greate heuines, looking only when he woulde giue vp the ghoſt: the holie maide came to him againe, and ſaid in his eare. Be not afraid, for yee ſhal not die at this time. The ſicke man both
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:8350:200"/> heard &amp; vnderſtood that word. (though before it ſeemed, that he was paſt all ſenſe.) And he tooke comfort in it, rather crediting the word of the holie maid, that ſounded in his eare, then the throwes of death, that griped him by the hart. Howbeit he ſhewed no token of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therefore they not vnderſtanding, what ſhe had ſaid, prouided lightes and other thinges neceſſarie for his burial, looking ſtill, when he would depart out of this life. And in this howerly expectation of death, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued certaine daies (longer in deed, then men are wont to liue, that are ſicke of that diſeaſe.) At the length when it ſeemed, that he was euen paſſing out of the wordle, the holie maid came to him againe, and ſpake theſe wordes in his eare. I commaund thee in the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that thou paſſe not at this tyme. At that word he tooke comfort of ſpirite and ſtrength of bodie, and roſe vp in his bed, and called for meate: and, in the preſence of them all eate his meate with good appetite, and receiued perfecte health, and liued after manie yeares: and was one of them, that were preſent with the holie maid in Rome, when ſhe departed out of this wordle. And he declared afterwardes what wordes the holie maid ſpake in his eare, &amp; how by the vertue of the ſame his ſoule, that was vpon the verie point of departing out of his bodie, was mightely reteined: adding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore that he eſteemed the miracle, that was
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:8350:200"/> wrought vpon him ſelfe, to be no leſſe, then if ſhe had raiſed him vp againe from death to life: and that without all doubt it was no natural cauſe that had reſtored him againe, but only the almightie power of God, working by the meanes of that holie maid. During this tyme of peſtile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the citie of Siena, it pleaſed God to worke an other miraculous cure by the meanes of the holy maid vpon Doct: <hi>Raimundus</hi> her owne ghoſtlie father, after this maner. The plague increaſed ſo ſore; and the inhabitantes fled ſo faſt for feare of infection (not only the citize<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but alſo the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes and religious perſones) that manie ſoules re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained without comfort or counſel. But doct: <hi>Raimundus</hi> taried ſtill in the citie &amp; would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue, but determined with him ſelfe, that he would viſite &amp; helpe as manie, as he could poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. The which charitable purpoſe being once knoue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was ſo much called vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; to earneſtly intreated to come now to one houſe and now to an other: (bicauſe there were fewe or none to helpe him) that he had ſcantly leiſure to eate his meate or to take his reſt. One night, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had reſted on his bed, &amp; thought to haue riſen vp af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his accuſtomed maner to ſay his ſeruice, he felt a verie great paine in his fla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ke. And feeling with his hand, he found, that there was a great ſweel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the place: (which made him ſore afraid.) For experience had taught him, that the diſeaſe bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commonly after that maner. Wherfore he laie ſtill in his bed, &amp; durſt not riſe, but began to
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:8350:201"/> thinke of death: euermore wiſhing, that it had ben daie, that he might haue gone and ſpoken with the holie maid before the diſeaſe had taken full place in him. In the meane tyme the ague came vpon him, and withal a great hedach which tormented him verie ſore, and were (as he knewe) vndoubted ſignes of the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that raigned ouer the citie at that tyme. The which notwithſtanding, he did, what he could, to make an end of his diuine ſeruice. In the mornyng, calling a felowe to him, he went with great paine towardes the holy maides hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,: whether, when he came, he found her not at home, For ſhe was gone out, to viſite an other, that was ſicke. Then, being no longer able to hold vp his head, he laied him ſelfe downe vpon a couch, that was there in her houſe: &amp; praied the ſiſters, that they wold ſend for her with al ſpeed. When the holie maid came home, and found him there, and vnderſtood in what caſe he was: ſhe kneeled downe by the bed, and, laying her hand vpon his forehead, ſhe began after her maner to lifte vp her hart to God in praier. And foorthwith he ſawe, that ſhe was quite abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from her bodilie ſenſes &amp; rauiſhed in ſprite. Which was no vnwonted ſight to him, nor yet vncomfortable, (at that tyme.) For he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped well, that ſhe ſhould obteine ſome great benefite for him, both of bodie and ſoule at Gods hand. When ſhe had continued after that maner about the ſpace of halfe an hower, he
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:8350:201"/> felt in him ſelfe a mightie alteration and ſtirring in euerie part of his bodie, and withal a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prouocation towardes a vomite: which he had ſeene to hapen before, to many, that had died of that diſeaſe. How beit it fell not ſo out with him, but rather contrariwiſe; For it ſeemed to him, that he felt ſenſibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how thoſe corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, that cauſed his paine, were violently drawen from within, to the vttermoſt partes of the bodie. And certaine he was, that he found preſent eaſe of his paines. And before the holie maid came to her ſelfe againe, he was fully and perfectly reſtored to his health: ſauing only that there remained a litle feeblenes in him, which (he thought) our Lord ſuffred to remaine in him, as a token either of the diſeaſe, that was cured, or els of the weakenes of his faith. So ſoone as the holie maid had obteined this grace at Gods hand for her ghoſtlie father, ſhe was foorthwith reſtored to her bodilie ſenſes. And, finding him as yet in ſome weakenes, ſhe wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her ſiſters to prouide ſome meate for him ſuch as is wont to be geuen to ſicke folkes. The which when he had receiued at her holie hand, ſhe willed him to lie downe and reſt a while: and ſo he did. And when he had reſted a litle tyme, he roſe vp and felt him ſelfe as ſtrong and in as good liking, as if he had neuer ben ſicke. Then ſaid the holie maid to him. Father, goe your waie, and labour about the edifying of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and be thankeful to almightie God, that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:8350:202"/> hath deliuered you out of this preſent danger. The like miracle did the holie maid worke about the ſame tyme vpon father <hi>Bartilmewe,</hi> of whome mention hath ben made diuerſe and ſundrie tymes before. The miracle was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: but the cure ſeemed ſomewhat greater, biauſe he was both longer and alſo more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly ſicke.</p>

                  <p>AFter the tyme, that this peſtilence was ceaſed in Siena, it chaunced that manie deuout and well diſpoſed perſones, as well religious as others, but ſpecially certaine Nunnes of Piſa, hearing the fame of the holie maid had a great deſire to ſee her, and to heare her doctrine, which was reported to be (and was in deed) verie wonderful. And becauſe it was not lawful for many of them that had this godly inclination, to come to her to Siena, they ſent letters and meſſengets to her very often, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeching her, that ſhe would take the paines to come ouer to them to Piſa. And, to allure her the more to take that iourney vpon her, they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto her, what frute and gaine of ſoules was like to enſue by her comyng thither. The holie maid, though ſhe had no deſire to be from home, yet being ouercome with their long &amp; importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:8350:202"/> ſute, eſpecially conſidering, that there was great hope of winning ſoules to God, firſt ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the aduiſe of them, that liued in houſe with her: of the which compaine ſome were with her going to Piſa, and ſome againſt it. Then, when ſhe ſawe, that ſhe could not be reſolued by men, ſhe fled vnto almightie God (as her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was) and beſought him humbly, that he would vouchſafe to make her to vnderſtand what his will and pleaſure was, that ſhe ſhould doe in that caſe. And it came to paſſe after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies, that our Lord appeered to her, and willed her, that ſhe ſhould accompliſh the godlie requeſt of thoſe his ſeruantes &amp; hand maides in Piſa without delaie. Wherupon ſhe went to her ghoſtelie father, and declaring thus much to him, beſought him like an obedient daughter, that he would geue her licence to doe, as ſhe was willed by God. He aſſented willingly to her demaund, and went him ſelfe with her, and with him two other of his brethren, to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the confeſſions of ſuch, as ſhould reſort vnto her, according to a graunt made to her by Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the eleuenth. When ſhe came to Piſa, ſhe lodged in the houſe of an honeſt citizen called maiſter <hi>Gerardus,</hi> where on a daie, there was preſented vnto her, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine younge man of the age of twentie yeares or there about, which had ben ſore vexed with a quotidian ague for the ſpace of a yeare and halfe, and neuer miſſed one daie.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:8350:203"/> And though there were no fit of an ague vpon him at that tyme, yet might ſhe ſee, that he had ben long ſicke. For, whereas he was by conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of bodie a verie ſtrong and luſtie yong man, he was now brought ſo lowe, that he had neither fleſh, ſtrength, nor colour. And no medicine could be found, that would doe him good. Wherfore they entreated the holie maid, that ſhe would commend his lamentable ſtate to God in her praier. The holie maid pitied his caſe verie much, and aſked him, how long it was, ſence he was laſt confeſſed. To that he anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered and ſaid, that it was a good manie yeares. Yea, ſaid ſhe; and that is the cauſe, whie our Lord hath laied this diſcipline vpon you, bicauſe yee would not clenſe your ſoule in all this tyme by confeſſion. Wherfore, deere ſonne, ſee that yee goe out of hand to confeſſion, and rid your ſelfe of theſe ſinnes, that haue infected you, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and ſoule. With that ſhe cauſed Doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her owne confeſſour to be called, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the yong man to him, willing him to heare his confeſſion. That done, the yong man returned to her againe: and ſhe laied her hand vpon his ſhoulder, and ſaid theſe wordes. Sonne, goe your waie with the peace of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: For I will not, that theſe agues trouble you anie more. She ſaid, and it was done: for the almightie power of him ſpake in her, who ſaid, and it was done, who gaue commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all thinges viſible and inuiſible were
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:8350:203"/> created. This ſtrange miracle was wrought before ſo manie witneſſes, that it was in a verie litle tyme bruted thoroughout the whole citie. And the yong man him ſelfe, that was cured, within a fewe daies after, came to Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> as he was paſſing by the citie, (ſo fat and in ſuch good liking, that the Doctour did ſcantly knowe him) and before a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men and women recited the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the miracle, as it hath ben declared here before: and thanked God and the holie maid moſt humbly, for the benefite of his health, which, he confeſſed, he had receiued perfectly at Gods handes, by her meanes and interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>One of the ſiſters of penance called <hi>Gemina,</hi> being ſo extremely pained with a diſeaſe of the throte, commonly called the Squynancie, that, ſo often as ſhe tooke breath, it ſeemed, that ſhe was in great danger of ſtrangling, found the meanes to be brought, where the holie maid was, and beſought her of helpe. The holie maid, being moued with compaſſion, laid her hand vpon the ſiſters throte, and made the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon it: and foorth with the diſeaſe lefte her, and ſhe returned home againe with great ioye. When the holie maid went from Piſa to Auinion, there were in her companie two deuout yong men, that wrote her letters, the one called <hi>Nerius Landoccius de Pagliar enſibus,</hi> which afterwardes forſooke the worlde vtterly &amp; became an Heremite, the other <hi>Steuen Corradi,</hi>
                     <pb n="409" facs="tcp:8350:204"/> which likewiſe gaue ouer the world at her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and became a Chriſtian: in the which rule &amp; diſcipline he lead a verie ſtreight &amp; holie life. Now, when the holy maid returned from Auinion into Italie againe, and was come to the citie of Genua, it chaunced this <hi>Nerius</hi> to be taken with ſuch a paineful gnawing and grieping in his bowels, that he cried pitifully, and crope vpon his handes and knees from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce to place (for he was not able to raiſe vp him ſelfe) and could find no place, where to reſt And thus he continued daie and night, without anie releaſe in extreme paine, and made great lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the reſt of the compaine, which loued him all verie tenderly. Wherupon doctour <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> with other of them wente to the holie maid, and told her, in what a lamentble caſe the poore man ſtood. She ſhewed, that ſhe had great compaſſion on him: but ſhe gaue them no word of comfort or hope of recouerie (as ſhe was wont to doe at other tymes but) contrariwiſe willed them to ſeeke to the phiſicions, and cauſe them to miniſter to the ſickeman. When they ſawe, that the would put them in no maner of comfort, they ſent out of hand for two learned phiſicions: which came and miniſtred to him with great diligence: and their precptes were obſerued verie preciſely. But the man recouered not, but ratherwaked worſe &amp; worſe, in ſo much that, at the length the phiſicions them ſelues ſaid to doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> that they deſpaired of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:8350:204"/> his health. The which iudgement of the phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions when doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> declared after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the reſt of the compaine as he was ſitting with them at ſupper: that other yong man called <hi>Steuen</hi> (of whome mention is made before) roſe vp ſodainly from the table with great feruour and vehemencie of ſpirite, and went to the holie maids chamber, and there caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſelfe downe at her feet wept bitterly, and beſought her in moſt humble maner, that ſhe would not ſuffer his brother &amp; companion to die in the waie, and his bodie to be buried in a ſtrange land, eſpecially conſidering, that he had taken that iourney vpon him for Gods ſake and for a charitable cauſe. With thoſe wordes ſhe was inwardly touched, and ſaid, vnto him, Sonne if God will now take your brother <hi>Nerius</hi> from you, &amp; reward him for all his paines in heauen, me thinketh, yee ſhould not be ſorie for it, but rather reioice. O good mother, ſaid he, I praie you, heare me at this tyme, and helpe him, for I doubt not, but that you are able to doe it, if you will. Then ſhe being no longer able to refraine her motherlie affection, ſpake thus vnto him. Sonne, my meanyng was to exhort you, that you ſhould comforme your will to the will of God. But now, ſeeing you are ſo much afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to morrowe in the mornyng, when I goe to heare Maſſe and to receiue the bleſſed Sacrament, put me in mynd and I promiſe you, that I will offer vp your petition vnto God.
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:8350:205"/> In the meane tyme praie you to God for me, that it maie pleaſe him to heare my praier. <hi>Steuen</hi> was glad of that promiſe, and the next daie he waited diligently for her. And when ſhe went to heare Maſſe, he kneeled downe before her verie humbly, and ſaid. I praie you, good mother, remember your promiſe made to me yeſter night. With that ſhe went to heare Maſſe, and after Maſſe receiued. And when ſhe had receiued, ſhe continued a certaine tyme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from her bodilie ſenſes (as her maner was.) So ſoone as ſhe came to her ſelfe againe, ſhe ſpake to <hi>Steuen</hi> (who attended there) with a cheereful countenance, and ſaid. Yee haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined the grace, that yee deſire. What, ſaid he, ſhall <hi>Nerius</hi> recouer? Yea, ſaid ſhe, for certaine <hi>Nerius</hi> ſhall recouer: for our Lord hath graunted him vnto vs. When <hi>Steuen</hi> heard that, he ranne to <hi>Nerius,</hi> and told him, what comfortable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des the holie maid had ſpoken. After that the phiſicions came againe to the ſicke man, and, conſidering diligently of the ſtate of his bodie, pronounced plainely, that they ſawe no hope of life in him. But whatſoeuer they ſawe in natural cauſes, <hi>Nerius</hi> was by the almightie power of God reſtored to perfecte health within a fewe daies, euen as the holie maid had ſaid. Soone after the recouerie of this man, it chaunced the ſame <hi>Steuen</hi> to fall ſicke alſo, being (as it was thought) ouercharged with watching and paines, that he had taken, about the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:8350:205"/> ſaid <hi>Nerius.</hi> He was ſore pained with ſtreynyng and vomiting, and withal with a paſſing great head ach. The which thing, when it was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified to the holie maid by the reſt of the houſe (who were all verie ſorie for him) ſhe went foorthwith to his beds ſide, where he laie, and aſked him, how he did, and felt his pulſes. Whereby ſhe perceiued well, that he had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſharpe feuer. Then ſhe ſpake to him with great feruour of ſpirite, and ſaid theſe wordes. I commaund thee in the vertue of holie obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that thou be no more ſicke of this ague. She had no ſooner ſpoken thoſe wordes, but that <hi>Steuen</hi> was fully and perfectly deliuered of his ague, and ſate vp, and made merrie with the reſt of his companie: and they all together praiſed the goodnes of God, that had geuen ſuch power to the holie maid.</p>
                  <p>At what tyme the holie maid was in the citie of Florence about a treatie of peace bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weene Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the eleuenth and the Florentines, there was ſuch a broile ſtirred in the citie, by certaine euel diſpoſed and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious citizens againſt the holie maid, that her freendes, doubting and fearing her life, counſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to depart. But ſhe made them anſwere, that ſhe had an expreſſe commaundement from God, not to depart, vntill the peace were fully agreed vpon, and openly publiſhed in the ſaid citie. Howbeit ſhe was contented a litle to geue place to the furie of the people, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:8350:206"/> her ſelfe into a ſecret place not farre from the citie, &amp; there to remaine for a tyme, vntill the tempeſt were ſomewhat aſſwaged. Now, as ſhe was preparing her ſelfe to his voiage, &amp; in a maner readie to ſet foreward, one of her ſiſters called <hi>Ione</hi> fell ſicke. Her foote was ſwollen very much (of what cauſe, no man knewe:) he paine &amp; anguiſh wherof was ſo great, that it caſt her into an ague alſo. By reaſon wherof ſhe was not in ſtate to take that iourney with the reſt of her compaine. VVhen the holie maid vnderſtood of her ſickenes, being vn willing to leaue her there behind (bicauſe ſhe was manie waies ſubiecte to the furie and malice of naughtie men) ſhe fled to her accuſtomed refuge of praier, &amp; beſought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of his infinity mercie, that he would prouide for the inde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nitie of her ſiſter. God heard the petition of his ſpouſe; For al the whil that ſhe continued thus in praier, that other ſiſter ſlept ſloundely. Out of the which ſleepe ſo ſoone as ſhe awaked, ſhe found her ſelfe in as perfecte health &amp; ſtrength, as if ſhe had neuer ben ſicke. And ſo ſhe roſe vp, &amp; ſet her ſelfe in order, &amp; went the ſame mornyng with the maid and the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine ſo nimbly, that they wer al aſtoined to ſe it.</p>
                  <p>When Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> had reſolued to remoue out of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto the citie of Rome againe, the holie maid likewiſe with doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> &amp; the reſt of her retinue, departed from auinion towardes Italie. And paſſing through the prouince they came to a citie called Tolonne: where when:
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:8350:206"/> they had taken vp their Inne, the holie maid, to auoid the preſſe of the people, which flocked meruelouſly about her in al places to doe her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, left her compaine, and (as her maner was) conueied her ſelfe as ſecretly, as was poſſible, to an inner chamber. And her whole compaine; knowing how troubleſome ſuch reſort had ben to her at at other tymes, did, what they could to prouide, that fewe or none ſhould knowe of her being there. But as they vſed all diligence to keepe the matter ſecret, ſo it ſeemed, that the verie ſtones of the ſtreete cried out, and be wrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to the people: for ſhe was no ſooner in her chamber, but that they came to the houſe from all partes of the citie flocking in great nombers, firſt of women, and then of men, and aſked wher that holie Ladie was, that came from the court of Rome. At the length, when Doct: <hi>Raimundus</hi> &amp; the reſt ſawe, that the matter could no longer be hidden, being ouercome with the importunate preſſing of the people, they were contented to admit the women only. Emong whome there was one, that had a yong infant ſo ſtrangely ſwollen, eſpecially in the bellie, that it ſeemed rather a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſter, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a child; for the which infant, the women beſought the holie maid, that ſhe would vouchſafe to take it into her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, ſhe refuſed it at the firſt for humilities ſake: but afterwardes, being ouercome with pitie and ſeeing their faith, ſhe yealded vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So ſone as the child was in her armes, it beganne to let out
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:8350:207"/> out great ſtore of wind, and with that (in the preſence of all that multitude) the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his bellie and whole bodie aſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: and ſhe gaue it againe to the mother in perfecte health and ſhape of bodie. The fame of this miracle being ſpread thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the citie, it came to the eares of the biſhop: Who ſent out of hand for Doctour <hi>Raimundus,</hi> and deſired him, that he would be a meane to the holie maid, that he might ſpeake with her: and told him withal, that the child, vpon whom this great miracle was wrought, was nephewe to his vicare generale.

But before her ſtore was ſpent, the harueſt tyme was come, and ſhe heard tell, that there was newe corne to be ſold in the market; wherupon ſhe thought to caſt awaie that litle portion, that was lefte

What will yee doe, ſaid ſhe? Will you caſt that awaie, that God hath ſent for the ſuſtenance of man? If you will not eate of that bread your ſelfe: yet beſtowe it vpon the poore, that haue no bread to eate.

But when they were baked, and ſet on the table to eate, they that eate of them, could find no maner of bitternes or euel taſt in them but rather ſaid, that they had not in their life tyme, eaten better
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:8350:208"/> and more ſauorie bread. This miracle being ſpread in the citie, doctour <hi>Thomas</hi> her confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour came, with certaine other learned men of his brethren, to examine the matter: and found in verie deed, that there were two great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought, one in augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting the quantitie of the paſt, and an other in amending the euel qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and ſtench of the corne. And the third mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was added ſoone after: which was, that wheras the ſame bread was verie liberally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt out to the poore, and none other eaten in the houſe but that, yet there remained euermore great ſtore of it in the hutch. And ſo it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manie daies and weekes. Which moued cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine deuout perſones, that vnderſtood the truth of the matter, to take ſome of the ſaid bread, and to laie it vp reuerently, where it might be kept for a relique and perpetual remembrance of the great worke, that almightie God had wrought by his deere ſpowſe. After wardes, Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> being deſirous to be more particularly infourmed of the matter by the holie maid, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her one a tyme in ſecret talke, that ſhe would declare vnto him for his ſatiſfaction, how, and in what order the thing had paſſed. And ſhe made him anſwere ſimply after this maner. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid ſhe, I had a great zeale, that the thing, that God had ſent vs for the reliefe of man, ſhould not be loſt. And I had withal a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on the poore. Wherupon I went to the hutch of meale with a great feruour of ſpirite.
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:8350:209"/> So ſoone as I was there, behold, our bleſſed La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was there likewiſe with me, accompanied with a nomber of Sainctes and Angels, and bad me to goe foreward with my worke, as I had determined.

                  <p>AT what tyme the holie maid came to Rome by commaundement of Pope <hi>Vrbanus</hi> the ſixt, ſhe had in her companie to the nomber of fower and twentie perſones, to wite, ſixtene men and eight women.

<pb n="420" facs="tcp:8350:209"/> certaine ſpiritual graces of the Popes holines, but all, as her ghoſtlie children, to be trained by her in the rules of ſpiritual life. Beſides theſe, there came to the citie at that tyme a nomber of good and godlie men: which, bicauſe they were ſent for by the Pope at the holie maides motion &amp; inſtance, reſorted vnto her, and lodged in her houſe. And though ſhe neither had, nor would haue anie thing for the reliefe of her ſelfe and al her familie, but only what ſhe receiued of pure almes: yet was ſhe ſo liberal and free of hart, &amp; had ſuch a loue to hoſpitalitie, that ſhe made no difference betweene receiuing one man and one hundred: for ſhe doubted not, but had a full truſt and affiance in God, that he would proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de for them all. For the better perfourmance wherof, ſhe tooke this order emong her women, that they ſhould be ſtewardes in the houſe by courſe one after an other euerie weeke; ſo that one of them was euermore occupied about the prouiſion of meate, drincke, &amp; other thinges; that the reſt might the more freely intend their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages &amp; other holie exerciſes, for the which they were come to the citie. And bicauſe the bread, that they eate, was all of almes, ſhe gaue them charge, that whoſoeuer was ſteward for the weeke, ſhould alwaies ſignifie to her a daie before the bread was all ſpent; that ſhe might ſend ſome other of the ſiſters, or goe her ſelfe to begge more.

Ah ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geue you. Wherefore haue you brought vs to this diſtreſſe, contrarie to the order, that I gaue you?

To that ſiſter <hi>Ione</hi> could ſaie nothing els but only acknowleged her forgetfulnes, and cried her mercie. VVell, ſaid the holie maid: cauſe them to ſit downe at the table. Alas, ſaid ſhe, there is not bread inough for fower perſones. whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer there is (ſaid the holie maid) will them to goe to dyner, and to begynne with that litle, that is, vntill God ſend more.

But our Lord at the inſtance of the holie maid ſo wrought in that bread, that they cut ſoppes into their potage, and eate euerie man ſo much as ſufficed: and yet was the
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:8350:210"/> bread nothing diminiſhed, but rather increaſed. Wherat when they were all aſtoined, they aſked what the holie maid was in doing. And vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſhe was earneſtly occupied in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they concluded all with one voice (which were in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber ſixteene perſones) that it was her praier that had procured that increaſe from he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auen; for, ſaid they, yee ſee that we are all ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the bread, that was ſet before vs, is not leſſe but rather more then it was at the begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng.

And withal he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them, to take a part of their pitance that daie with the couent. When this ſolemnitie was ended, and the tyme come, that they ſhould goe to dyner, the brother, that had the charge of the butterie, came to the priour with a heauie countenance, and told him, that there was not bread inough in the howſe, to ſuffice the one halfe of the couent, and much leſſe to ſuffice the ſtrangers alſo, that were inuited: which were to the nomber of twentie perſones.

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:8350:212"/> and much leſſe, electuaries, or anie other the like confortatiues, that were made of ſweet thinges, Wherefore he came to her, and praied her, that ſhe would ſuffer them at the leaſt to put a litle ſugar into the cold water, that ſhe droncke. To that ſhe anſwered quickely, and ſaid. Alas father, that litle life, that is lefte in my bodie, yee goe about to quench vtterly, for yee knowe, that all ſweet thinges are become verie hurtful and deadlie to me. Then Doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> and the ſaid maiſter <hi>Gerard,</hi> in whoſe houſe ſhe laie, began to deuiſe carefully, what thing they might doe to relieue and comfort her, if it were poſſible. And it came to their myndes, (which they had ſeene oftentymes proued in the like caſes) that when a ſicke perſone was not able to receiue anie ſuſtenance inwardly, it was good to take red wine, and with the ſame to waſh the temples and pulſes of his hand-wreſtes. VVherupon maiſter <hi>Gerard</hi> ſent to one of his neighbours, which was wont euermore to haue one veſſel of that wine, and praied him, that he would be ſo good, as to ſend him a botel of it.

And with that he would needes haue him downe into the cellar, and ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed him the veſſel. Wherein that red wine had ben. And the meſſenger might well perceiue, that the veſſel was drie, and that it had ſtood long emptie But yet the good man, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re aſſurance, in his preſence would needes drawe out the ſpigot alſo: that he might ſee it with his eyes, and ſo ſatisfie maiſter <hi>Gerardes</hi> mynd. So ſoone as he had taken out the ſpigot, behold, there iſſued out of the veſſel a goodlie red wine, which ranne abondantly, euen as from a full tappe, and wette all the ground vnderneth. VVherat the good man of the houſe was mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelouſly aſtoined: and putting vp the ſpigot againe, called all that were in his houſe, both men and women, and examined them diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if anie of them knewe of anie wine, that was put into that veſſel. They ſaid all and ſware alſo, that the veſſel had ſtood emptie for the ſpace of three monethes before; and they thought it not only vnlike, but alſo impoſſible, that anie creature ſhould bring ſo much wine into the houſe, and put it into the veſſel without their knowledge. Which made them to thinke (as it was in deed) that this wine was ſent them from God to the behoofe and comfort of the holie
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:8350:213"/> maid. And when the meſſenger, that was ſent from maiſter <hi>Gerard,</hi> came home with his bottel ful of that wine, and declared to him and the reſt, what had happened: they all tooke great comfort in it, and magnified the bountifull goodnes of almightie God, that had ſo mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly prouided for the reliefe of his true handmaid. The fame of this miracle being ſpread thorough out the citie it chanced within a fewe daies after, when the holie maid was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, that ſhe had an occaſion to goe abroad, to viſite a certaine patriarke, that was newly come to the citie, ſent from the Sea Apoſtlolike. While ſhe paſſed thorough the ſtreetes, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, hauing vnderſtanding of her comyng abroade, forſooke their worke and ſhoppes, and ranne from all partes of the citie to ſee her, and ſaid. What a woman is this, that drincketh wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her ſelfe, and yet filleth our veſſels with wine? VVhen the holie maid ſawe that preſſe of the people, and vnderſtood the cauſe of the ſame, it went to the verie hart of her: as ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared afterwardes in confeſſion to her ghoſtlie Father. And therefore ſhe turned her ſelfe to almightie God after a ſorowful maner &amp; ſpake to him in her hart after this ſort. O Lord, whie haſt thou plagued me thy poore hand-maid thus, as to make me a laughing ſtocke to all the people? All other thy ſeruantes maie be ſeene emong men: only I can not. Who deſired this wine of thee for me? Thou knoweſt, O Lord,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:8350:214"/> that I haue long forborne the drincking of wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: and now for a litle wine I am made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke in euerie mans mouth. I moſt humbly beſeech thee (O my deere Lord) for all the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that euer thou haſt ſhewed vnto me thine vnworthie handmaid, that thou wilt cauſe this wine vtterly to vaniſh awaie, in ſuch ſort, that the brute, that is raiſed of me emong the people, maie ceaſe withal. Thus ſhe praied with deepe ſighes and inward gronyng of hart: and our Lord deſpiſed not her praier; For, wheras the people repaired ſtil to the houſe to drinke of the wine, and manie honeſt citizens drancke of it for pure deuotion, and euermore perceiued that there was nothing the leſſe wine for all their drincking: comyng now to the veſſel to drincke, they found, that all the wine was turned to thicke dregges. And wheras before it was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie pleaſant wine, it was now of a ſodaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo pudlie and vnpleaſant, that no man might abide to drincke of it. VVhich thing cauſed a great alteration in the myndes of the people; For wheras before they thought &amp; ſpake verie reuerently of the holie maid, manie of them began now to imagin, that this wine was a thing counterfeicted by the deuel, and that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God, to make ſuch treacherie knowen to the wordle, had turned it vnto dregges. VVhich made the good man of the houſe and all other, that had before by occaſion of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, geuen the holie maid a report of great
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:8350:214"/> vertue and holines, ſo much aſhamed, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes they durſt not once to open their mouthes, to ſpeake anie thing, that tended to her commendation. But the holie maid her ſelfe was verie glad of it, and gaue God moſt humble thankes, that had deliuered her from ſuch vaine and troubleſome applauſes of the people. VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin ſhe ſhewed her ſelfe in deed to be the true diſciple and folower of our Sauiour Chriſt, whoſe maner it was euermore, when he had wrought miracles, to auoid the fauourable ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of men.

But a charitable mynd would rather interprete them thus: that our Lord ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in the foremer miracle, how much he loued her, and in the latter, how ſhe anſwered his loue againe with a profound humilitie In the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer he gaue vs matter to praiſe her, in the later example to folowe her.

Then ſaid the child to her. Abide here a while, and thou ſhalt ſee, what is in yonder ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle. He had no ſooner ſpoken thoſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but that there appeered an other child like him, which brought a ladder, and with a golden keie, that he had in his hand opened the doore of the tabernacle. When the doore was open, ſhe ſawe a meruelous goodlie and beawtiful yong maid, roially appareled all in ſhynyng white, with collars and owches of price. She ware three crownes vpon her head, which were verie finely wrought and ſet together in ſuch ſort, that euerie one of them might be perfectly ſeene and diſcerned from the other. The lower crowne was al of pure ſiluer, and ſhewed white. The ſecond was of ſyluer myngled with gold, and ſhewed a certaine gliſtering red colour, ſuch as is wont to be when an orient red ground is wrought ouer with threedes of gold. The third and higheſt crowne was all of pure gold, richly, decked and ſet rownd about with perles and precious ſtones. The widowe, beholding this goodlie ſight, began to reaſon with her ſelfe, what yong maid that might be, that was ſo
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:8350:216"/> gorgiouſly trymed. And looking ſteddily on her, ſhe might well diſcerne, that it was the face of <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena: but her age was not anſwerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Which made her to ſuſpecte, that it ſhould be ſome other. Then the child, that appeered to her firſt, asked her whether ſhe knewe that faire maid, or no. Truly, ſaid ſhe, this is the verie face of <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena: but her age agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. While the woman ſtood thus and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked wiſhly vpon her, the yong maid, that was within the tabernacle, ſmyled ſweetly, and ſaid to thoſe two children. Loe, this woman knoweth me not. After this, there came fower other children, like vnto theſe, and brought with them a ſettle to carrie one in, made in fourme like a bride chamber, and furniſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly with ritch clothes of a purple colour. And when they had ſet downe this chamber or ſettle by the aforeſaid tabernacle of ſyluer, they went vp nymbly, and tooke the yong maid, that was there crowned in their handes, to bring her downe and put her in that chamber. But while this was in doing, the yong maid ſpake to thoſe children and ſaid. Let me goe a litle to that woman firſt, that ſeeth me now, and knoweth me not. And with that ſhe went towardes her, as it were fleeing, and ſaid vnto her. <hi>Semia,</hi> do not you knowe me? I am <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena, euen as my face ſheweth. What, ſaid <hi>Semia?</hi> Are you <hi>Caterine</hi> my ſpiritual mother? I am, ſaid ſhe. But marcke well, what thou haſt ſeene, and what thou ſhalt ſee. When the bleſſed virgin
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:8350:217"/> had ſpoken thoſe wordes, the ſixe children too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke her, and brought her backe to the ſaid bride chamber: and placed her in the ſame, and ſo lifted her vpon high. <hi>Semia</hi> ſtood ſtill and looked after, to ſee, what would become of her. And behold, ſhe ſawe in heauen a ſeate, and vpon the ſeate a king ſitting, royally clad and crowned, hauing in his right hand a booke open. The children mounted vp with their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, vntil they came to the foote of this ſeate: and there they ſet downe the bed chamber and the maid in it. And ſhe foorthwith went out of the chamber, and caſt her ſelfe downe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the feete of the king, and worſhipped him. That done, the king ſaid to her. Welco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me my right deerely beloued ſpowſe and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Caterine.</hi> Then, being commaunded by the king, ſhe lifte vp her head, and read in the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke, that he held in his right hand, ſo long, as a man would well ſaie a <hi>Pater noſter.</hi> When ſhe had done that, the king commaunded her to ſtand vp. And ſo ſhe did, and ſtood by the ſeate loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the comyng of the Queene: Which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me foorthwith, accompained with a goodlie traine of virgins, and went (as it ſeemed) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the king. When the Queene approched neere, the holie maid went downe from the place, where ſhe ſtood, and kneeling vpon her knees, worſhiped her. The Queene embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced her verie louingly, and ſaid. Hartely wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, my deere daughter <hi>Caterine.</hi> And with that ſhe tooke her vp and kiſſed her. Then the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:8350:217"/> holie maid kneeled downe againe, and worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Queene. And, when ſhe had ſo done, ſhe went by commaundement of the Queene to all the reſt of the virgins, one after an other and they all receiued her likewiſe with paſſing great ioye and kiſſed her. Now <hi>Semia,</hi> that ſtood and behold all theſe thinges was ſo moued with the ſight, that ſhe cried out alowde, and ſaid. O bleſſed Ladie, O mother of our Lord &amp; Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Ieſus Chriſt, make interceſſion for vs. And againe ſhe ſaid. O bleſſed <hi>Marie Magdalene,</hi> O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed S. <hi>Catherine,</hi> O bleſſed S. <hi>Agnes,</hi> O bleſſed S. <hi>Margarite</hi> praie for vs. And with this crie ſhe awaked out of her ſleepe: and openyng her eyes ſawe, that the ſonne was of a great height. Wherof being verie ſorie, both for the high Maſſe, which, ſhe doubted, would be almoſt done, before ſhe could come to her pariſh Church, and alſo for her childrens dyner, which could not be made readie againſt the due tyme, ſhe began to thinke with her ſelfe, what the cauſe ſhould be, whie that vnwonted and ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge viſion ſhould be ſhewed vnto her: for ſhe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knewe nor ſuſpected, that the holie maid ſhould be departed out of this life: though ſhe knewe well, that ſhe was verie ſicke: bicauſe ſhe had ſeene by experience, that the holie maid had often tymes recouered and eſcaped out of ſickeneſſes, that ſeemed verie grieuous and paſt all hope of recouerie. VVherefore ſhe rather thought, that for ſo long tyme as ſhe had ben
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:8350:218"/> occupied about this viſion, the holie maid had ben after her accuſtomed maner in ſome ſingular traunſe or abſtractio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in the which our Lord had ſhewed vnto her ſome great and notable reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. But bicauſe the mornyng was ſo farre ſpent, that ſhe ſtood in doubt of finding anie Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that daie, ſhe ſuppoſed, that all this viſion was none other thing, but only ſome ſuttle illuſion of the deuel, to make her to tranſgreſſe the comma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undement of our holie mother the Church, in not hearing Maſſe on the ſondaie Wherefore ſhe haſted her ſelfe vp, and ſet her pot ouer the fyer, and ranne towardes the pariſh Church, ſaying thus in her hart. If I leeſe Maſſe this daie, I will take all this to be the worke of the ghoſtlie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. But if I come in good tyme to heare Maſſe, then will I thinke, that our Lord hath ſhewed theſe thinges vnto me for my good mother <hi>Catherines</hi> ſake. When ſhe came to the Church, ſhe found, that the goſpel was done, and the offertorie ſong. Wherof ſhe was verie ſorie, and ſaid. Out vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me wretch, the wicked feend hath deceiued me. With that ſhe made haſt hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes againe to ſet her thinges in the kitchen a litle foreward: that ſhe migh goe to ſome other Church, and find a whole Maſſe. While ſhe was at home thus occupied, ſhe heard a bell ring to Maſſe in a monaſterie of Nunnes not farre from her houſe: which made her a glad woman. And ſo ſhe ſet her ſelfe in order againe to goe to Church, and for haſt lefte her colewortes, (which ſtood
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:8350:218"/> by her readie piked and wasſhed) euen as they were, and put them not into the pot, as ſhe had thought to doe, VVhen ſhe came to the Church ſhe found them at the verie begynnyng of Maſſe wherof ſhe was verie glad, and ſaid to her ſelfe. Surely, now I ſee, that the deuel hath not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me: as, I thought, he had done. But ſhe had great care of the diſpleaſure of her ſonnes, which were now of good yeares, bicauſe ſhe knewe, their dyner was nor readie, nor could not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de readie in anie conuenient tyme. Houbeit ſhe committed all to God, that ſhe might heare Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe deuoutly; beſeeching him notwithſtanding, that if that viſion were of him, he would ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, that there might no diſpleaſure or cauſe of offence riſe of the ſame betwene her &amp; her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And with that ſhe ſet her ſelfe downe and heard out the whole Maſſe to the end: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Maſſe was done as ſhe was going homeward, her ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes met with her in the ſtreete, &amp; ſaid. Mother, it is very late. I praie you, let vs goe to diner. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a litle, good children, ſaid ſhe: &amp; you ſhal dyne in good tyme. She went home a pace, and found the doore faſt locked and the keie within, euen as ſhe had lefte it. So ſoone as ſhe was within the houſe, ſhe we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſtreight to the kitchin, &amp; thought to haue gone foreward with the dreſſing of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But when ſhe came in, ſhe ſawe, that all was done to her hand: her colewoortes and fleſh tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly ſodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; al other thinges in ſuch readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that they might goe to the table when they would.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:8350:219"/> VVherat ſhe was much aſtoined, and ſaid to her ſelfe. Surely, now I ſee, our Lord hath heard my praier. And ſhe determined to goe after dyner to the holie maides houſe (whome ſhe thought to be yet aliue in the wordle) and to tell her of all the thinges, that had chaunced that daie. Her ſonnes, that were not farre from the houſe, ſhe called home, and ſet them to dyner. And while they were eating, her mynd ranne ſtill vpon the ſtrange viſion, that ſhe had ſeene in the mornyng, and vpon theſe wonders, that had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued vpon the ſame. Her ſonnes alſo, that knewe nothing of the matter, began to commend their meate, and ſaid, that it was paſſing well ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and had a farre better taſt, then it was wont to haue. Which wordes ſhe put vp in her hart, and ſaid to her ſelfe (as ſhe declared afterwardes to Doctour <hi>Raimundus.)</hi> O my good mother <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine,</hi> it is thou, that haſt come this mornyng into my houſe, to ſupplie my rome and office in the kitchen. Now I knowe, in deed, that thou art a holie virgin, &amp; the true ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maid of Chriſt. And yet for all this, ſhe ſuſpected nothing of the holie maides departure out of this life: but, ſo ſoone as her ſonnes had dined, ſhe went forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to her houſe (as ſhe was wont to doe at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tymes) and knocked at the doore: but no bodie giue her anſwere. The neighbours told her, that of likelihood ſhe was gone out (as her maner was) to viſite ſome holie place, and that there was no bodie at home. Which ſhe ſuppoſed to
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:8350:219"/> be true, &amp; therfore went her waie. Now the truth was, that all thoſe, that vvere vvithin, vvere in great heauines for the loſſe of their good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vvhich vvas departed from them, and had lefte them as motherles children in this wicked worlde. And they did, what they could, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale her death from the people: both for the auoiding of that great preſſe and tumulte, which, they knewe would be made, if her death were once noiſed; and alſo, that they might with the more quietnes conferre with diſcreete perſones concernyng the maner and order of her funerals. But, howſoeuer they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keepe the matter ſecret, the next daie, when her bodie ſhould be caried to the Church of the Fryers preachers, commonly called <hi>Our ladie ouer Minerua,</hi> it was knowen all ouer the citie. And there was ſuch a concourſe of people, runnyng and preſſing towardes the place, where ſhe laie, to touch ſome part either of her bodie or of her garmentes, that thoſe of her familie &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, that were there attending vpon the corps, were in great feare and danger, to haue had both their garmentes torne from their backes, and their bodies ſore hurt with the violent preſſe &amp; crowd of the vnrulie multitude. In ſo much that they were conſtreined to remoue the beere from the place, where it ſtood, and to ſet it in S. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nickes</hi> chappel, which was well defended with a ſtrong grate of yron. While theſe thinges were in doing, <hi>Semia</hi> came thither by chaunce: and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:8350:220"/> ſeeing ſuch a great concourſe of people, aſked what it meaned. They made her anſwere, and ſaid, that <hi>Catherine</hi> of Siena was dead, and that her bodie was there caried to the Church to be buried, VVhen ſhe heard that, ſhe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

VVhen ſhe came thither, and ſawe certaine women and ſiſters of the holie maides familie ſtanding about her bodie: ſhe cried out and ſaid. O moſt cruel women, whie haue you kept the departure of my ſweet mother ſecret from me? wherefore would yee not call me, to be preſent with others at her paſſage out of the worlde? They excuſed them ſelues, alleaging certaine reaſonable cawſes: which did in ſome degree ſatisfie her mynd. VVell then, ſaid ſhe: I praie you, tell me what tyme ſhe departed. Yeſter daie, ſaid they, about eight of the clocke ſhe gaue vp the ghoſt. VVith that ſhe rent her owne face with her nailes, and cried out ruthfully. I ſawe her: I ſawe my ſweet mother, euen when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of her bodie. I ſawe her caried vp into heauen by the miniſterie of Angels, crowned with three precious crownes, &amp; clad ſolomnely with ſtatelie robes of ſhynyng white<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now I knowe, that it was our Lord, that ſent his Angel, to ſhewe me the departure of my good mother.

O mother, O deere mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ſweete mother, whie wouldeſt thou not geue me to vnderſtand, that it was thou, that diddeſt depart out of this life? VVhen ſhe had thus eaſed her hart ſomewhat with weeping and ſpeaking, she declared to thoſe religious ſiſters, and to the reſt, that ſtoode there about the beere, what a goodlie viſion our Lord had shewed her, at that verie tyme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holie maid paſſed out of this world, with all ſuch other thinges, as haue ben recited here to fore.

                  <p>Emong others, they brought in a child of fower yeares old, whoſe ſinowes in his necke were ſhronken, that he held his head euermore

And foorthwith the child be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to amend: and in the preſence of all that people, within a verie litle tyme lifte vp his head, and was fully and perfectly healed.</p>
                  <p>After this, an honeſt citizen of Rome called <hi>Lucius Cauarulis,</hi> which was ſo grieuouſly pained with an incurable diſeaſe in his hippe and leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, that he could ſcantly endure to goe a verie litle waie with the helpe of a ſtaffe or crooch, hearing the fame of the great miracles, that were wrought by almightie God in the honour of the holie maid, came with paſſing great paine and trauaile to the Church of the Friers preachers.

                  <p>A certaine Romaine called <hi>Typreus</hi> had a daughter, which in her tender age fel into a verie grieuous infirmitie called the ptiſicke: of the which ſhe could not be cured by anie medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.

                  <p>In this tyme likewiſe, while the bodie of the holie maid laie aboue the ground, there was in Rome a certaine citizen called <hi>Antonie Lellipeeters,</hi> which by ouer labouring his bodie had fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a nommenes of his limmes, that he was, as it were, an impotent man, and could neither walke nor ſtand.

This <hi>Antonie,</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, what wonderful thinges were done by the holie maid, commended him ſelfe deuoutly vnto her, and made a vowe, that he would doe ſome ſpecial thing to her might honour if he be deliuered by her merites. He had no ſooner ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out that vowe in his hart, but that he felt him ſelfe perfectly healed, both of his lamenes and paine: and began to walke as nymbly, as euer he did in his life before: &amp; went by and by to the place, where the holie corps laie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed his vowe: and declared with great ioye in the preſence of all the people there aſſembled at that tyme, what a wonderful grace he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at Gods hand, through the merites of that holie maid.</p>

This <hi>Paula</hi> was, at the tyme of the holie mades departure, pained with two diſeaſes: which had continued vpon her four monethes before. The one was the gowte: the other the paine of the flancke. And, becauſe theſe two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies were of ſuch contrarie qualitie, that whatſoeuer was miniſtred vnto her for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe of the one, was hurtful to the other: (the one requiring thinges to looſe, the other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie wiſe thinges to bind) the ſicke woman was pitifully vexed, and manie tymes brought euen to the verie point of death. When the holie maid paſſed out of this life, ſhe beſought them, that were about her, verie inſtantly, that they would let her haue certaine thinges, that had touched the holie maides bodie. The which thinges being geuen vnto her ouer night, the next mornyng ſhe roſe out of her bed (which ſhe was neuer able to doe in fower monethes before) and walked as luſtely as euer ſhe had do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, when ſhe was in her beſt health. Theſe and manie other miracles did almightie God worke to the honour of the holie maid in thoſe three daies, while her bodie laie vnburied: which through the negligence of men, were not ſo du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined and diligently writen, as theſe.</p>

                     <p>What miracles almightie God wrought, to honour the holie maid, after her burial.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <head>Chap. 11.</head>
                  <p>WHen the holie maides bodie had ben thus kept three daies and three nightes aboue the ground; they buried it. Howbeit almightie God ceaſed not to honour his deere ſpouſe with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles: but wrought both moe and greater thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, then before.</p>
                  <p>A certaine Romaine called <hi>Iohn Veries,</hi> had a litle ſonne, which could neither goe nor ſtand vpright on his feete. This man, hearing by others, what great miracles were wrought by
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:8350:224"/> the holie maide, made a vowe to God and her, for the recouerie of his child: and brought him to the place, where ſhe was buried. So ſoone as the child was laied vpon the holie maides graue, his feete and legges receiued firmenes and ſtrength, and he began to ſtand vpright and walke ſo well, as if he had neuer had anie ſuch defecte.</p>
                  <p>In like maner one <hi>Iohn Tozos,</hi> had a verie ſtrange and horrible infirmitie in his eyes: in ſo much that there bred wormes in one of his eyes. This <hi>Iohn</hi> made a vowe to the bleſſed virgin S. <hi>Catherine:</hi> and foorthwith he was perfectly he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aled of his paineful and lothſome diſeaſe. Wherupon he went to the holie maides graue, and offred vp a certaine memorial of waxe (as the maner is) in token of his deliuerie: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, what a wonderful grace he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo a certaine woman, that came out of Germanie to the citie in pilgrimage: whoſe name by negligence of them, that were appointed to write theſe thinges, was not taken. This pilgrymme had with long ſickenes, as it were, loſt the vſe of her eyes, and was without hope to recouer the ſame by anie medicine. Wherefore ſhe commended her ſelfe deuoutly to the holie maid, and made a vowe. So ſoone as ſhe had ſo done, ſhe receiued her ſight againe, and came to the graue to perfourme her vowe: and ſawe as well, as euer ſhe had done in
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:8350:224"/> her life before.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo a woman of honour in Rome, called ladie <hi>Marie:</hi> which had ſuch a grieuous paine in her head, that in continua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of time ſhe loſt one of her eyes, though ſhe had vſed diuerſe and ſundrie medecines for the ſauing of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. For the which cauſe, partly for ſorowe, and partly for ſhamefaſtnes, ſhe kept her ſelf euermor within her owne houſe, &amp; would not be ſeene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, neither in the church nor els wher in any open place. This ladie, vnderſtanding by others what great thinges had ben wrought in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the holie maid, commended her ſelfe vnto her, and made a vowe. The night folowing, the holie maid appeered to one of her waiting women in her ſleepe, and willed her to tell her ladie, that ſhe ſhould make no mo medecines for her eyes, but ſhould goe euerie mornyng to Church to heare the diuine ſeruice: and ſo doing ſhe ſhould find helpe. The ladie hearing that, did as ſhe was willed by her ſeruant, and found, as ſhe was promiſed by the holie maid: For ſhe recouered not only ſtrenght for that eye, that remained (which was much weakened) but alſo perfecte ſight in that other eye, that was quite out. And (which was the greateſt cure of all) the eye of her mynd was alſo reſtored in ſuch ſort, that ſhe ſawe now, how to obſerue the commaundement of God in going to the ſermons, and keeping holie the ſondaies and other holie daies commaunded by our holie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church.</p>
                  <pb n="451" facs="tcp:8350:225"/>
                  <p> There was alſo a certaine yong man in Rome called <hi>Iames,</hi> the ſonne of a certaine citizen called <hi>Peeter Nicols,</hi> which with long ſickenes at the length was brought ſo lowe, that it booted not to miniſter anie more phiſicke vnto him. When all men had geuen him ouer, as a dead man, a certaine deuout woman that was about him, called <hi>Cecola Cartaria,</hi> made a vowe to the bleſſed virgin S. <hi>Caterine</hi> in his behalfe: and foorthwith the yong man began to amend, and within a verie litle tyme, was fully recouered of his diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>In like maner, a certaine woman called <hi>Gilia Petruccies,</hi> when the phiſicions had geuen their diffinitiue ſentence, that by the courſe of nature ſhe muſt needes die, made the like vowe to S. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi> of Siena: and with that found preſent eaſe of her paine, and within a fewe daies after was perfectly reſtored to her health.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo at this tyme in the citie, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine noble and deuout woman, called Ladie <hi>Ione Ilperines,</hi> which was well acquenited with the holie maide in her life tyme. And therefore ſeeing the miracles, that were wrought after her death, ſhe conceiued the greater opinion of holines in her. In ſo much that, whereſoeuer ſhe went to viſite anie, that were ſicke and diſeaſed ſhe would alwaies perſwade with them, that they ſhould commend them ſelues deuoutly to the holie virgin S. <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena. By the which meanes ſhe procured the recouerie of a
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:8350:225"/> great manie that were ſicke of diuerſe and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>On a tyme it chaunced, that one of this ladies owne children; ſporting and runnyng rechleſly (as yong children are wont to doe) in an vpper lofte of the houſe, fell downe headlong to the ground in her preſence. She, ſeeing the ſodaine fall of her child, whome, as a good mother, ſhe could not but loue tenderly, and conſidering of the thing, as it was like to be in the diſcourſe of man (which was, that her ſonne ſhould either die preſently, or els at the leaſt be ſore crusſhed that he ſhould prooue but a criple or wraile all the daies of his life after) cried out mightely and ſaid. O bleſſed S. <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend my child to thee. It is a wonderful matter to conſider, that, though the height and other condicions of the place, from whence the child fell, were ſuch, that in reaſon they might hope of none other, but only preſent death, yet, when they came to take vp the child, they found, that he had no maner of harme in anie part of his bodie, but was fully in as good caſe and liking after that great fall, as he was before. When the mother ſawe that, ſhe gaue moſt humble than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes to almightie God and to his deere ſpowſe S. <hi>Caterine:</hi> and ceaſed not, whereſoeuer ſhe came, to ſet out her holines and vertues to the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of her power.</p>
                  <p>There was alſo a poore woman in the citie called <hi>good Ione,</hi> which, being a common lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:8350:226"/> gate a poore liuing by ſeruing of others, &amp; ſpecially by waſhing of clothes. This <hi>Ione</hi> was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing on a tyme by the riuers ſide called Tiber, happened emong other clothes to waſh a quilte, of the which one part was in the riuer, and the other vnder her hand in waſhing. But, that part, the ſwame in the riuer, being heauier then the other, of a ſodaine drewe that part, that was in wasſhing, from vnder her, and ſo the whole was caried away with the ſwaie of the ſtreame. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſawe the quilt gone, &amp; knewe, that, if it were loſt, ſhe was neuer able to paie for it: hauing a greater care to recouer the quilt, then to ſaue her ſelfe, ſhe reached ſo farre after it, that ſhe fell into the water alſo, and was caried likewiſe a good waie from the land. Being there in great diſtreſſe, and deſtitute of all mans helpe, it came to her mynd, what great miracles were wrought at that time in the citie by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie maid. Wherupon ſhe cried out, &amp; ſaid. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed virgin S. <hi>Catherine</hi> of Siena, helpe me now in this great need. She had no ſooner ſpoken thoſe wordes, but that foorthwith ſhe was holpen vp by the almightie hand of God, and brought againſt the courſe of the ſtreame, and ſet with the quilt in her hand vpon the bancke, without anie helpe of man. When ſhe ſawe her ſelfe there, and could not imagin, how ſhe came thither: ſhe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God with all her hart, and aſcribed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of her eſcaping from that preſent danger (as it was in deed) to the merites of B. S. <hi>Caterine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="454" facs="tcp:8350:226"/>
                  <p> Not long after the death of the holy maid, doct. <hi>Raimund.</hi> being made the general ouer his whole order, came to Rome, as his charge requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And being there, tranſlated the holie bodie of S. <hi>Caterine</hi> vpon that verie daie, that ſhe had prophecied, that it ſhould be done manie yeares before. By trauailing wherin, &amp; in other affaires apperteining to his office, his bodie was diſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered in ſuch ſort, that he had need to haue the aduiſe of ſome learned phiſicion. Wherupon he ſent for one, that dwelt ther by, not farre from the monaſterie, called maiſter <hi>Iames</hi> of our Ladie the round: which coming one time to viſite doct: <hi>Raimundus</hi> &amp; talking of the holy maid, told him of a very ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge thing, that had chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced in his oune knouledge to a certaine yong man called <hi>Colas</hi> of Ciuccio. This <hi>Colas</hi> lay ſick in his father in lawes houſe (whoſe name was <hi>Cincius Tancancim)</hi> of a ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie grieuous diſeaſe in his throte, called the Squi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie. Which increaſed ſo mightely vpon him, that the phiſicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s gaue him ouer, &amp; ſaid plainely, that by the courſe of nature he muſt needes die, &amp; that within a verie fewe houers, when the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was euen at the point of death, <hi>Alexia</hi> hearing of it (who loued <hi>Cincius</hi> wel, bicauſe he was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout man and bare a ſingular affection to the holie maid in her life tyme) went to the houſe in great haſt, and tooke with her a tooth of the holie maid: which ſhe kept as a great relike and iewel. And when ſhe came &amp; ſawe the yong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it were, vpon paſſing out of this wordle,
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:8350:227"/> by reaſon that the apoſteme had ſtreightened his throte ſo much that he was euen at the point of choking: ſhe put the ſaid tooth to his throte. And foorthwith the apoſteme brake, and he lifted vp his head, and auoided a great quantitie of rotten matter out at his mouth. And within a very litle tyme, he recouered perfectly, &amp; gaue moſt hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes to almighty God &amp; to his glorious ſpouſe S. <hi>Caterine:</hi> by the vertue of whoſe tooth, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed in al companies &amp; in all places, whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he came, that he had ben deliuered euen from preſent death. In ſo much that one tyme, when doctour <hi>Raimundus</hi> had made a ſermon in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the holy maid, &amp; had emong other thinges touched this preſent miracle: the yong man being there at that tyme by chance, ſtood vp befor al the people, &amp; ſaid theſe wordes. It is true, that yee ſaie, maiſter doctour: for I am the man, vpon whom this great miracle was wrought.</p>
                  <p>At what tyme queene <hi>Ione</hi> of Sicilia ſent <hi>Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi> of Vrſine with a great companie of men of armes againſt Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> the ſixt, with purpoſe either to expell him out of the citie, or els to take him, and ſo to put him to death: the Romaines ſtood verie duetifully, and fought manie ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes in the defence of their citie and bisſhop. In the which ſkirmiſhes manie of them (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the inferiour ſort) were taken by the enemie, and cruelly handled. Some were tied vp againſt trees, and ſo let alone, that they might die a long and paineful death. Some other, that
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:8350:227"/> were thought to be of ſome abilitie to ranſome them ſelues, were lead into a brode field, and there, after diuerſe and ſundrie horrible tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, fettered with chaines and boltes of yron. Of theſe it was generally marcked, that, ſo manie as called vpon S. <hi>Caterine</hi> of Siena, were foorthwith looſed of their bandes, &amp; returned home to their owne houſes. And ſome of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to doct. <hi>Raimundus,</hi> and declared to him and other, how wonderfully our Lord had wrought for their deliuerance.</p>
                  <p>Theſe thinges did almightie God worke, to honour the holie virgin after her death &amp; burial, with many other, that were not writen, through the neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a certaine notarie, whome doct. <hi>Raimundus</hi> put in truſt. Bicauſe he was him ſelfe at that tyme an old man, &amp; could not remember ſo manie thinges, as were credibly reported to him, ſo particularly &amp; ſo preciſely, as, he knewe, was requiſite for the credit of a holie legend or hiſtorie of a Sainctes life. Howbeit whatſoeuer lacked in him or in the notarie, was in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſupplied by the deuotion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch benefites. Of the which there came a meruelous great no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber both men &amp; women, and offred vp (as the maner is) certaine images of wax vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be: in the which was expreſſed, as wel as they could, the maner of each miracle, to the honour of God the worker and geuer of all good thinges, and of his glorious ſpowſe S. <hi>Caterine,</hi> in contemplation of whoſe merites it pleaſed him to worke ſuch good thinges at that tyme.</p>
